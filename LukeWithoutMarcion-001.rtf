I'm sure History valley has some opinions to attract the cult members, because he has seen all the evidence I have. His latest is considering that marcion is an abridgement of cononical Luke, not proto Luke. I was going to say, if that is so you easily procuce the text he removed do a video on that, and it should read like an adbridgement. I think Luke edited and added text to change the meaning, since Marcion was first to pull certain documents together to make a Gospel, why would he do all that work? anyway, I thought you could help, produce the edited text for me, i.e. the Luke that is not in Marcions Luke, as it is (as best we understand it). He'll just make it easier to do a video on it.}

The relationship between Marcion's Gospel and the canonical Gospel of Luke has been a subject of scholarly debate for centuries. Marcion, a 2nd-century Christian teacher, produced a text known as the "Gospel of the Lord," which bears significant similarities to the Gospel of Luke but also notable differences. The central question is whether Marcion's Gospel is an abridged version of Luke or if Luke expanded upon Marcion's text.}

Conclusion}
\par \pard\plain \s24\loch\sl276\slmult1\sb0\sa140\cf1\ql\ltrpar{\loch
While it's challenging to produce an exact "edited text" of Luke that excludes Marcion's content, focusing on the infancy narratives, Jewish integrative passages, and post-resurrection appearances provides a framework. This approach suggests that the author of Luke sought to present a more comprehensive narrative, integrating Jesus firmly within Jewish tradition and prophecy, countering Marcion's theological positions.}
\par \pard\plain \s24\loch\sl276\slmult1\sb0\sa140\cf1\ql\sb0\sa0\ltrpar{\loch
For a more detailed analysis, consulting scholarly reconstructions of Marcion's Gospel, such as those by Adolf von Harnack or Dieter T. Roth, can offer deeper insights into the textual variations and their theological implications. }

Canonical Luke contains frequent references to the fulfillment of Jewish prophecy, particularly in Jesus\u8217\'92 passion and resurrection narratives (e.g., Luke 22:37, Luke 24:44). These references are absent in Marcion\u8217\'92s version, which aligns with his theology that rejects the Old Testament God and its prophecies.}

Canonical Luke weaves Jesus\u8217\'92 story into the fabric of Jewish history and prophecy, presenting him as the fulfillment of the Law and Prophets. This directly counters Marcion's view, which sought to sever Christianity from its Jewish roots. Many of the added sections seem designed to reinforce this connection.}

Marcion emphasized Jesus as a savior sent by a higher, previously unknown God, distinct from the creator-God of the Old Testament. Canonical Luke, with its references to prophecy fulfillment and Jewish scripture, presents a more integrated Christology that ties Jesus to the God of Israel.}

The inclusion of post-resurrection appearances and teachings in canonical Luke establishes the authority of the apostles and the continuity of the church. This aligns with the Catholic view of apostolic succession, contrasting Marcion\u8217\'92s narrower focus on Paul\u8217\'92s writings.}

It seems more plausible that canonical Luke represents an expansion of Marcion\u8217\'92s shorter text rather than Marcion\u8217\'92s text being an abridgement of Luke. Scholars generally agree that scribes and editors were far more likely to add explanatory and theological material than to remove it, especially material that would align with orthodox theology.}

Marcion\u8217\'92s Gospel and theology likely represented an early, streamlined version of Christian doctrine. The church\u8217\'92s response\u8212\'97embodied in canonical Luke\u8212\'97was to produce a more robust and integrated narrative that defended Jesus\u8217\'92 Jewish roots and addressed emerging theological debates.}

Conclusion}
\par \pard\plain \s24\loch\sl276\slmult1\sb0\sa140\cf1\ql\ltrpar{\loch
The evidence strongly supports the idea that canonical Luke is an expanded version of Marcion\u8217\'92s Evangelion, rather than the reverse. The additions in canonical Luke reflect theological, liturgical, and ethical concerns of the early church, often in direct response to Marcion's interpretation of Christianity.}
\par \pard\plain \s24\loch\sl276\slmult1\sb0\sa140\cf1\ql\ltrpar{\loch
While Marcion\u8217\'92s Gospel may not represent the \u8220\'93original\u8221\'94 form of Luke, it provides a critical lens through which we can understand the development of early Christian texts and theology. The differences between the two highlight the complex process of gospel formation and the diversity of early Christian thought.}
