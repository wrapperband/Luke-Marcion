<p>I'm sure History valley has some opinions to attract the cult
members, because he has seen all the evidence I have. His latest is
considering that marcion is an abridgement of cononical Luke, not
proto Luke. I was going to say, if that is so you easily procuce the
text he removed do a video on that, and it should read like an
adbridgement. I think Luke edited and added text to change the
meaning, since Marcion was first to pull certain documents together
to make a Gospel, why would he do all that work? anyway, I thought
you could help, produce the edited text for me, i.e. the Luke that is
not in Marcions Luke, as it is (as best we understand it). He'll just
make it easier to do a video on it.</p>

<p>The relationship between Marcion's Gospel and the canonical Gospel
of Luke has been a subject of scholarly debate for centuries.
Marcion, a 2nd-century Christian teacher, produced a text known as
the &quot;Gospel of the Lord,&quot; which bears significant
similarities to the Gospel of Luke but also notable differences. The
central question is whether Marcion's Gospel is an abridged version
of Luke or if Luke expanded upon Marcion's text.</p>
<p><strong>Marcion's Gospel: A Brief Overview</strong></p>
<p>Marcion's Gospel lacks several elements present in canonical Luke,
including:</p>
<ul>
	<li><p><strong>Infancy Narratives:</strong> The birth and early life
	of Jesus are absent.</p></li>
	<li><p><strong>Old Testament References:</strong> Passages
	connecting Jesus to Jewish prophecy and law are omitted.</p></li>
	<li><p><strong>Post-Resurrection Appearances:</strong> Certain
	accounts of Jesus appearing after his resurrection are missing.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>These omissions align with Marcion's theological stance, which
rejected the Old Testament deity and sought to present Jesus as the
messenger of a higher, previously unknown God.</p>
<p><strong>Canonical Luke: Additions and Redactions</strong></p>
<p>If we consider the possibility that the author of Luke expanded
upon Marcion's Gospel, the following sections can be seen as
additions:</p>
<ol>
	<li><p><strong>Infancy Narratives (Luke 1–2):</strong> The
	detailed accounts of the births of John the Baptist and Jesus,
	including genealogies and prophecies.</p></li>
	<li><p><strong>Integration with Jewish Tradition:</strong> Passages
	that emphasize Jesus' fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies and
	his adherence to Jewish customs.</p></li>
	<li><p><strong>Post-Resurrection Narratives (Luke 24):</strong>
	Detailed stories of Jesus' appearances to his disciples after his
	resurrection, such as the encounter on the road to Emmaus.</p></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Implications for Reconstruction</strong></p>
<p>To reconstruct the text that canonical Luke might have added to
Marcion's Gospel, one would focus on these sections:</p>
<ul>
	<li><p><strong>Luke 1–2:</strong> The birth narratives and
	genealogies.</p></li>
	<li><p><strong>Luke 3:1–4:13:</strong> Including the baptism and
	temptation of Jesus.</p></li>
	<li><p><strong>Luke 24:</strong> The detailed resurrection
	appearances.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, numerous verses throughout Luke that reference
Jewish law, prophets, and traditions could be considered later
additions to align the text with proto-orthodox Christian views.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>While it's challenging to produce an exact &quot;edited text&quot;
of Luke that excludes Marcion's content, focusing on the infancy
narratives, Jewish integrative passages, and post-resurrection
appearances provides a framework. This approach suggests that the
author of Luke sought to present a more comprehensive narrative,
integrating Jesus firmly within Jewish tradition and prophecy,
countering Marcion's theological positions.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">For a more detailed analysis,
consulting scholarly reconstructions of Marcion's Gospel, such as
those by Adolf von Harnack or Dieter T. Roth, can offer deeper
insights into the textual variations and their theological
implications.

<p>Here is the reconstructed text of <strong>canonical Luke</strong>,
based on what scholars suggest Marcion might have removed or altered
in his version of the Gospel. I'll begin with the <strong>first
manageable chunk</strong>, the <strong>infancy narratives</strong>
(Luke 1:1–2:52), since these were not present in Marcion's Gospel.
Let’s reconstruct:</p>
<hr/>

<h3><strong>Luke 1:1–25</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Dedication to Theophilus and Announcement of John the
Baptist’s Birth</strong></p>
<p>1 Many have undertaken to draw up an account of the things that
have been fulfilled among us,<br/>
2 just as they were handed down to
us by those who from the first were eyewitnesses and servants of the
word.<br/>
3 With this in mind, since I myself have carefully
investigated everything from the beginning, I too decided to write an
orderly account for you, most excellent Theophilus,<br/>
4 so that
you may know the certainty of the things you have been taught.</p>
<p>5 In the time of Herod king of Judea there was a priest named
Zechariah, who belonged to the priestly division of Abijah; his wife
Elizabeth was also a descendant of Aaron.<br/>
6 Both of them were
righteous in the sight of God, observing all the Lord’s commands
and decrees blamelessly.<br/>
7 But they were childless because
Elizabeth was not able to conceive, and they were both very old.</p>
<p>8 Once when Zechariah’s division was on duty and he was serving
as priest before God,<br/>
9 he was chosen by lot, according to the
custom of the priesthood, to go into the temple of the Lord and burn
incense.<br/>
10 And when the time for the burning of incense came,
all the assembled worshipers were praying outside.</p>
<p>11 Then an angel of the Lord appeared to him, standing at the
right side of the altar of incense.<br/>
12 When Zechariah saw him,
he was startled and was gripped with fear.<br/>
13 But the angel said
to him: “Do not be afraid, Zechariah; your prayer has been heard.
Your wife Elizabeth will bear you a son, and you are to call him
John.<br/>
14 He will be a joy and delight to you, and many will
rejoice because of his birth,<br/>
15 for he will be great in the
sight of the Lord. He is never to take wine or other fermented drink,
and he will be filled with the Holy Spirit even before he is born.<br/>
16
He will bring back many of the people of Israel to the Lord their
God.<br/>
17 And he will go on before the Lord, in the spirit and
power of Elijah, to turn the hearts of the parents to their children
and the disobedient to the wisdom of the righteous—to make ready a
people prepared for the Lord.”</p>
<p>18 Zechariah asked the angel, “How can I be sure of this? I am
an old man, and my wife is well along in years.”<br/>
19 The angel
said to him, “I am Gabriel. I stand in the presence of God, and I
have been sent to speak to you and to tell you this good news.<br/>
20
And now you will be silent and not able to speak until the day this
happens, because you did not believe my words, which will come true
at their appointed time.”</p>
<p>21 Meanwhile, the people were waiting for Zechariah and wondering
why he stayed so long in the temple.<br/>
22 When he came out, he
could not speak to them. They realized he had seen a vision in the
temple, for he kept making signs to them but remained unable to
speak.</p>
<p>23 When his time of service was completed, he returned home.<br/>
24
After this his wife Elizabeth became pregnant and for five months
remained in seclusion.<br/>
25 “The Lord has done this for me,”
she said. “In these days he has shown his favor and taken away my
disgrace among the people.”</p>
<hr/>

<h3><strong>Luke 1:26–56</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Announcement of Jesus’ Birth and Mary’s Visit to
Elizabeth</strong></p>
<p>26 In the sixth month of Elizabeth’s pregnancy, God sent the
angel Gabriel to Nazareth, a town in Galilee,<br/>
27 to a virgin
pledged to be married to a man named Joseph, a descendant of David.
The virgin’s name was Mary.<br/>
28 The angel went to her and said,
“Greetings, you who are highly favored! The Lord is with you.”</p>
<p>29 Mary was greatly troubled at his words and wondered what kind
of greeting this might be.<br/>
30 But the angel said to her, “Do
not be afraid, Mary; you have found favor with God.<br/>
31 You will
conceive and give birth to a son, and you are to call him Jesus.<br/>
32
He will be great and will be called the Son of the Most High. The
Lord God will give him the throne of his father David,<br/>
33 and he
will reign over Jacob’s descendants forever; his kingdom will never
end.”</p>
<p>34 “How will this be,” Mary asked the angel, “since I am a
virgin?”</p>
<p>35 The angel answered, “The Holy Spirit will come on you, and
the power of the Most High will overshadow you. So the holy one to be
born will be called the Son of God.<br/>
36 Even Elizabeth your
relative is going to have a child in her old age, and she who was
said to be unable to conceive is in her sixth month.<br/>
37 For no
word from God will ever fail.”</p>
<p>38 “I am the Lord’s servant,” Mary answered. “May your
word to me be fulfilled.” Then the angel left her.</p>
<p>39 At that time Mary got ready and hurried to a town in the hill
country of Judea,<br/>
40 where she entered Zechariah’s home and
greeted Elizabeth.<br/>
41 When Elizabeth heard Mary’s greeting,
the baby leaped in her womb, and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy
Spirit.<br/>
42 In a loud voice she exclaimed: “Blessed are you
among women, and blessed is the child you will bear!<br/>
43 But why
am I so favored, that the mother of my Lord should come to me?<br/>
44
As soon as the sound of your greeting reached my ears, the baby in my
womb leaped for joy.<br/>
45 Blessed is she who has believed that the
Lord would fulfill his promises to her!”</p>
<p>46 And Mary said:<br/>
“My soul glorifies the Lord<br/>
47 and
my spirit rejoices in God my Savior,<br/>
48 for he has been mindful
of the humble state of his servant.<br/>
From now on all generations
will call me blessed,<br/>
49 for the Mighty One has done great
things for me—<br/>
holy is his name.<br/>
50 His mercy extends to
those who fear him,<br/>
from generation to generation.<br/>
51 He
has performed mighty deeds with his arm;<br/>
he has scattered those
who are proud in their inmost thoughts.<br/>
52 He has brought down
rulers from their thrones<br/>
but has lifted up the humble.<br/>
53
He has filled the hungry with good things<br/>
but has sent the rich
away empty.<br/>
54 He has helped his servant Israel,<br/>
remembering
to be merciful<br/>
55 to Abraham and his descendants forever,<br/>
just
as he promised our ancestors.”</p>
<p>56 Mary stayed with Elizabeth for about three months and then
returned home.</p>

<p>Here is the continuation of the reconstructed text from canonical
Luke, focusing on content likely omitted by Marcion.</p>
<hr/>

<h3><strong>Luke 1:57–80</strong></h3>
<p><strong>The Birth of John the Baptist</strong></p>
<p>57 When it was time for Elizabeth to have her baby, she gave birth
to a son.<br/>
58 Her neighbors and relatives heard that the Lord had
shown her great mercy, and they shared her joy.</p>
<p>59 On the eighth day they came to circumcise the child, and they
were going to name him after his father Zechariah,<br/>
60 but his
mother spoke up and said, “No! He is to be called John.”</p>
<p>61 They said to her, “There is no one among your relatives who
has that name.”<br/>
62 Then they made signs to his father, to find
out what he would like to name the child.<br/>
63 He asked for a
writing tablet, and to everyone’s astonishment he wrote, “His
name is John.”<br/>
64 Immediately his mouth was opened and his
tongue set free, and he began to speak, praising God.</p>
<p>65 All the neighbors were filled with awe, and throughout the hill
country of Judea people were talking about all these things.<br/>
66
Everyone who heard this wondered about it, asking, “What then is
this child going to be?” For the Lord’s hand was with him.</p>
<p>67 His father Zechariah was filled with the Holy Spirit and
prophesied:</p>
<p>68 “Praise be to the Lord, the God of Israel,<br/>
because he
has come to his people and redeemed them.<br/>
69 He has raised up a
horn of salvation for us<br/>
in the house of his servant David<br/>
70
(as he said through his holy prophets of long ago),<br/>
71 salvation
from our enemies<br/>
and from the hand of all who hate us—<br/>
72
to show mercy to our ancestors<br/>
and to remember his holy
covenant,<br/>
73 the oath he swore to our father Abraham:<br/>
74 to
rescue us from the hand of our enemies,<br/>
and to enable us to
serve him without fear<br/>
75 in holiness and righteousness before
him all our days.</p>
<p>76 And you, my child, will be called a prophet of the Most
High;<br/>
for you will go on before the Lord to prepare the way for
him,<br/>
77 to give his people the knowledge of salvation<br/>
through
the forgiveness of their sins,<br/>
78 because of the tender mercy of
our God,<br/>
by which the rising sun will come to us from heaven<br/>
79
to shine on those living in darkness<br/>
and in the shadow of
death,<br/>
to guide our feet into the path of peace.”</p>
<p>80 And the child grew and became strong in spirit; and he lived in
the wilderness until he appeared publicly to Israel.</p>
<hr/>

<h3><strong>Luke 2:1–20</strong></h3>
<p><strong>The Birth of Jesus</strong></p>
<p>1 In those days Caesar Augustus issued a decree that a census
should be taken of the entire Roman world.<br/>
2 (This was the first
census that took place while Quirinius was governor of Syria.)<br/>
3
And everyone went to their own town to register.</p>
<p>4 So Joseph also went up from the town of Nazareth in Galilee to
Judea, to Bethlehem the town of David, because he belonged to the
house and line of David.<br/>
5 He went there to register with Mary,
who was pledged to be married to him and was expecting a child.<br/>
6
While they were there, the time came for the baby to be born,<br/>
7
and she gave birth to her firstborn, a son. She wrapped him in cloths
and placed him in a manger, because there was no guest room available
for them.</p>
<p>8 And there were shepherds living out in the fields nearby,
keeping watch over their flocks at night.<br/>
9 An angel of the Lord
appeared to them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them, and
they were terrified.<br/>
10 But the angel said to them, “Do not be
afraid. I bring you good news that will cause great joy for all the
people.<br/>
11 Today in the town of David a Savior has been born to
you; he is the Messiah, the Lord.<br/>
12 This will be a sign to you:
You will find a baby wrapped in cloths and lying in a manger.”</p>
<p>13 Suddenly a great company of the heavenly host appeared with the
angel, praising God and saying,<br/>
14 “Glory to God in the
highest heaven,<br/>
and on earth peace to those on whom his favor
rests.”</p>
<p>15 When the angels had left them and gone into heaven, the
shepherds said to one another, “Let’s go to Bethlehem and see
this thing that has happened, which the Lord has told us about.”<br/>
16
So they hurried off and found Mary and Joseph, and the baby, who was
lying in the manger.<br/>
17 When they had seen him, they spread the
word concerning what had been told them about this child,<br/>
18 and
all who heard it were amazed at what the shepherds said to them.<br/>
19
But Mary treasured up all these things and pondered them in her
heart.<br/>
20 The shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God
for all the things they had heard and seen, which were just as they
had been told.</p>

<p>Here’s the continuation of the reconstructed text, focusing on
canonical Luke content not included in Marcion's Gospel.</p>
<hr/>

<h3><strong>Luke 2:21–40</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Jesus Presented in the Temple</strong></p>
<p>21 On the eighth day, when it was time to circumcise the child, he
was named Jesus, the name the angel had given him before he was
conceived.</p>
<p>22 When the time came for the purification rites required by the
Law of Moses, Joseph and Mary took him to Jerusalem to present him to
the Lord<br/>
23 (as it is written in the Law of the Lord, “Every
firstborn male is to be consecrated to the Lord”),<br/>
24 and to
offer a sacrifice in keeping with what is said in the Law of the
Lord: “a pair of doves or two young pigeons.”</p>
<p>25 Now there was a man in Jerusalem called Simeon, who was
righteous and devout. He was waiting for the consolation of Israel,
and the Holy Spirit was on him.<br/>
26 It had been revealed to him
by the Holy Spirit that he would not die before he had seen the
Lord’s Messiah.<br/>
27 Moved by the Spirit, he went into the
temple courts. When the parents brought in the child Jesus to do for
him what the custom of the Law required,<br/>
28 Simeon took him in
his arms and praised God, saying:</p>
<p>29 “Sovereign Lord, as you have promised,<br/>
you may now
dismiss your servant in peace.<br/>
30 For my eyes have seen your
salvation,<br/>
31 which you have prepared in the sight of all
nations:<br/>
32 a light for revelation to the Gentiles,<br/>
and the
glory of your people Israel.”</p>
<p>33 The child’s father and mother marveled at what was said about
him.<br/>
34 Then Simeon blessed them and said to Mary, his mother:
“This child is destined to cause the falling and rising of many in
Israel, and to be a sign that will be spoken against,<br/>
35 so that
the thoughts of many hearts will be revealed. And a sword will pierce
your own soul too.”</p>
<p>36 There was also a prophet, Anna, the daughter of Penuel, of the
tribe of Asher. She was very old; she had lived with her husband
seven years after her marriage,<br/>
37 and then was a widow until
she was eighty-four. She never left the temple but worshiped night
and day, fasting and praying.<br/>
38 Coming up to them at that very
moment, she gave thanks to God and spoke about the child to all who
were looking forward to the redemption of Jerusalem.</p>
<p>39 When Joseph and Mary had done everything required by the Law of
the Lord, they returned to Galilee to their own town of Nazareth.<br/>
40
And the child grew and became strong; he was filled with wisdom, and
the grace of God was on him.</p>
<hr/>

<h3><strong>Luke 2:41–52</strong></h3>
<p><strong>The Boy Jesus at the Temple</strong></p>
<p>41 Every year Jesus’ parents went to Jerusalem for the Festival
of the Passover.<br/>
42 When he was twelve years old, they went up
to the festival, according to the custom.<br/>
43 After the festival
was over, while his parents were returning home, the boy Jesus stayed
behind in Jerusalem, but they were unaware of it.<br/>
44 Thinking he
was in their company, they traveled on for a day. Then they began
looking for him among their relatives and friends.<br/>
45 When they
did not find him, they went back to Jerusalem to look for him.<br/>
46
After three days they found him in the temple courts, sitting among
the teachers, listening to them and asking them questions.<br/>
47
Everyone who heard him was amazed at his understanding and his
answers.<br/>
48 When his parents saw him, they were astonished. His
mother said to him, “Son, why have you treated us like this? Your
father and I have been anxiously searching for you.”</p>
<p>49 “Why were you searching for me?” he asked. “Didn’t you
know I had to be in my Father’s house?”<br/>
50 But they did not
understand what he was saying to them.</p>
<p>51 Then he went down to Nazareth with them and was obedient to
them. But his mother treasured all these things in her heart.<br/>
52
And Jesus grew in wisdom and stature, and in favor with God and man.</p>

<p>Here’s the continuation from <strong>Luke 3 onward</strong>,
which introduces John the Baptist and Jesus’ early ministry,
including the genealogy that Marcion likely excluded.</p>
<hr/>

<h3><strong>Luke 3:1–20</strong></h3>
<p><strong>John the Baptist Prepares the Way</strong></p>
<p>1 In the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar—when
Pontius Pilate was governor of Judea, Herod tetrarch of Galilee, his
brother Philip tetrarch of Iturea and Traconitis, and Lysanias
tetrarch of Abilene—<br/>
2 during the high-priesthood of Annas and
Caiaphas, the word of God came to John son of Zechariah in the
wilderness.<br/>
3 He went into all the country around the Jordan,
preaching a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins.</p>
<p>4 As it is written in the book of the words of Isaiah the
prophet:<br/>
“A voice of one calling in the wilderness,<br/>
‘Prepare
the way for the Lord,<br/>
make straight paths for him.<br/>
5 Every
valley shall be filled in,<br/>
every mountain and hill made low.<br/>
The
crooked roads shall become straight,<br/>
the rough ways smooth.<br/>
6
And all people will see God’s salvation.’”</p>
<p>7 John said to the crowds coming out to be baptized by him, “You
brood of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the coming wrath?<br/>
8
Produce fruit in keeping with repentance. And do not begin to say to
yourselves, ‘We have Abraham as our father.’ For I tell you that
out of these stones God can raise up children for Abraham.<br/>
9 The
ax is already at the root of the trees, and every tree that does not
produce good fruit will be cut down and thrown into the fire.”</p>
<p>10 “What should we do then?” the crowd asked.</p>
<p>11 John answered, “Anyone who has two shirts should share with
the one who has none, and anyone who has food should do the same.”</p>
<p>12 Even tax collectors came to be baptized. “Teacher,” they
asked, “what should we do?”</p>
<p>13 “Don’t collect any more than you are required to,” he
told them.</p>
<p>14 Then some soldiers asked him, “And what should we do?”<br/>
He
replied, “Don’t extort money and don’t accuse people falsely—be
content with your pay.”</p>
<p>15 The people were waiting expectantly and were all wondering in
their hearts if John might possibly be the Messiah.<br/>
16 John
answered them all, “I baptize you with water. But one who is more
powerful than I will come, the straps of whose sandals I am not

fire.<br/>
17 His winnowing fork is in his hand to clear his

burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire.”</p>
<p>18 And with many other words John exhorted the people and
proclaimed the good news to them.<br/>
19 But when John rebuked Herod
the tetrarch because of his marriage to Herodias, his brother’s
wife, and all the other evil things he had done,<br/>

this to them all: He locked John up in prison.</p>

<h3><strong>Luke 3:21–22</strong></h3>
<p><strong>The Baptism of Jesus</strong></p>
<p>21 When all the people were being baptized, Jesus was baptized
too. And as he was praying, heaven was opened<br/>
22 and the Holy
Spirit descended on him in bodily form like a dove. And a voice came
from heaven: “You are my Son, whom I love; with you I am well
pleased.”</p>

<h3><strong>Luke 4:1–13</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Jesus Is Tested in the Wilderness</strong></p>
<p>1 Jesus, full of the Holy Spirit, left the Jordan and was led by
the Spirit into the wilderness,<br/>
2 where for forty days he was
tempted by the devil. He ate nothing during those days, and at the
end of them he was hungry.</p>
<p>3 The devil said to him, “If you are the Son of God, tell this
stone to become bread.”</p>
<p>4 Jesus answered, “It is written: ‘Man shall not live on bread
alone.’”</p>
<p>5 The devil led him up to a high place and showed him in an
instant all the kingdoms of the world.<br/>
6 And he said to him, “I
will give you all their authority and splendor; it has been given to
me, and I can give it to anyone I want to.<br/>
7 If you worship me,
it will all be yours.”</p>
<p>8 Jesus answered, “It is written: ‘Worship the Lord your God
and serve him only.’”</p>
<p>9 The devil led him to Jerusalem and had him stand on the highest
point of the temple. “If you are the Son of God,” he said, “throw
yourself down from here.<br/>
10 For it is written:<br/>
“‘He
will command his angels concerning you<br/>
to guard you
carefully;<br/>
11 they will lift you up in their hands,<br/>
so that
you will not strike your foot against a stone.’”</p>
<p>12 Jesus answered, “It is said: ‘Do not put the Lord your God
to the test.’”</p>
<p>13 When the devil had finished all this tempting, he left him
until an opportune time.</p>
<hr/>

<h3><strong>Luke 4:14–30</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Jesus Rejected at Nazareth</strong></p>
<p>14 Jesus returned to Galilee in the power of the Spirit, and news
about him spread through the whole countryside.<br/>
15 He was
teaching in their synagogues, and everyone praised him.</p>
<p>16 He went to Nazareth, where he had been brought up, and on the
Sabbath day he went into the synagogue, as was his custom. He stood
up to read,<br/>
17 and the scroll of the prophet Isaiah was handed
to him. Unrolling it, he found the place where it is written:</p>
<p>18 “The Spirit of the Lord is on me,<br/>
because he has
anointed me<br/>
to proclaim good news to the poor.<br/>
He has sent
me to proclaim freedom for the prisoners<br/>
and recovery of sight
for the blind,<br/>
to set the oppressed free,<br/>
19 to proclaim
the year of the Lord’s favor.”</p>
<p>20 Then he rolled up the scroll, gave it back to the attendant and
sat down. The eyes of everyone in the synagogue were fastened on
him.<br/>
21 He began by saying to them, “Today this scripture is
fulfilled in your hearing.”</p>
<p>22 All spoke well of him and were amazed at the gracious words
that came from his lips. “Isn’t this Joseph’s son?” they
asked.</p>
<p>23 Jesus said to them, “Surely you will quote this proverb to
me: ‘Physician, heal yourself!’ And you will tell me, ‘Do here
in your hometown what we have heard that you did in Capernaum.’”</p>
<p>24 “Truly I tell you,” he continued, “no prophet is accepted
in his hometown.<br/>
25 I assure you that there were many widows in
Israel in Elijah’s time, when the sky was shut for three and a half
years and there was a severe famine throughout the land.<br/>
26 Yet
Elijah was not sent to any of them, but to a widow in Zarephath in
the region of Sidon.<br/>
27 And there were many in Israel with
leprosy in the time of Elisha the prophet, yet not one of them was
cleansed—only Naaman the Syrian.”</p>
<p>28 All the people in the synagogue were furious when they heard
this.<br/>
29 They got up, drove him out of the town, and took him to
the brow of the hill on which the town was built, in order to throw
him off the cliff.<br/>
30 But he walked right through the crowd and
went on his way.</p>
<hr/>

<h3><strong>Luke 4:31–44</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Jesus Drives Out an Impure Spirit</strong></p>
<p>31 Then he went down to Capernaum, a town in Galilee, and on the
Sabbath he taught the people.<br/>
32 They were amazed at his
teaching, because his words had authority.</p>
<p>33 In the synagogue there was a man possessed by a demon, an
impure spirit. He cried out at the top of his voice,<br/>
34 “Go
away! What do you want with us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to
destroy us? I know who you are—the Holy One of God!”</p>
<p>35 “Be quiet!” Jesus said sternly. “Come out of him!” Then
the demon threw the man down before them all and came out without
injuring him.</p>
<p>36 All the people were amazed and said to each other, “What
words these are! With authority and power he gives orders to impure
spirits and they come out!”<br/>
37 And the news about him spread
throughout the surrounding area.</p>
<p><strong>Jesus Heals Many</strong></p>
<p>38 Jesus left the synagogue and went to the home of Simon. Now
Simon’s mother-in-law was suffering from a high fever, and they
asked Jesus to help her.<br/>
39 So he bent over her and rebuked the
fever, and it left her. She got up at once and began to wait on them.</p>
<p>40 At sunset, the people brought to Jesus all who had various
kinds of sickness, and laying his hands on each one, he healed
them.<br/>
41 Moreover, demons came out of many people, shouting,
“You are the Son of God!” But he rebuked them and would not allow
them to speak, because they knew he was the Messiah.</p>
<p>42 At daybreak, Jesus went out to a solitary place. The people
were looking for him and when they came to where he was, they tried
to keep him from leaving them.<br/>
43 But he said, “I must
proclaim the good news of the kingdom of God to the other towns also,
because that is why I was sent.”<br/>
44 And he kept on preaching
in the synagogues of Judea.</p>

<h3><strong>Luke 5:1–11</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Jesus Calls His First Disciples</strong></p>
<p>1 One day as Jesus was standing by the Lake of Gennesaret, the
people were crowding around him and listening to the word of God.<br/>
2
He saw at the water’s edge two boats, left there by the fishermen,
who were washing their nets.<br/>
3 He got into one of the boats, the
one belonging to Simon, and asked him to put out a little from shore.
Then he sat down and taught the people from the boat.</p>
<p>4 When he had finished speaking, he said to Simon, “Put out into
deep water, and let down the nets for a catch.”</p>
<p>5 Simon answered, “Master, we’ve worked hard all night and
haven’t caught anything. But because you say so, I will let down
the nets.”</p>
<p>6 When they had done so, they caught such a large number of fish
that their nets began to break.<br/>
7 So they signaled their
partners in the other boat to come and help them, and they came and
filled both boats so full that they began to sink.</p>
<p>8 When Simon Peter saw this, he fell at Jesus’ knees and said,
“Go away from me, Lord; I am a sinful man!”<br/>
9 For he and all
his companions were astonished at the catch of fish they had
taken,<br/>
10 and so were James and John, the sons of Zebedee,
Simon’s partners.</p>
<p>Then Jesus said to Simon, “Don’t be afraid; from now on you
will fish for people.”<br/>
11 So they pulled their boats up on
shore, left everything and followed him.</p>
<hr/>

<h3><strong>Luke 5:12–16</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Jesus Heals a Man With Leprosy</strong></p>
<p>12 While Jesus was in one of the towns, a man came along who was
covered with leprosy. When he saw Jesus, he fell with his face to the
ground and begged him, “Lord, if you are willing, you can make me
clean.”</p>
<p>13 Jesus reached out his hand and touched the man. “I am
willing,” he said. “Be clean!” And immediately the leprosy left
him.</p>
<p>14 Then Jesus ordered him, “Don’t tell anyone, but go, show
yourself to the priest and offer the sacrifices that Moses commanded
for your cleansing, as a testimony to them.”</p>
<p>15 Yet the news about him spread all the more, so that crowds of
people came to hear him and to be healed of their sicknesses.<br/>
16
But Jesus often withdrew to lonely places and prayed.</p>
<hr/>

<h3><strong>Luke 5:17–26</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Jesus Forgives and Heals a Paralyzed Man</strong></p>
<p>17 One day Jesus was teaching, and Pharisees and teachers of the
law were sitting there. They had come from every village of Galilee
and from Judea and Jerusalem. And the power of the Lord was with
Jesus to heal the sick.</p>
<p>18 Some men came carrying a paralyzed man on a mat and tried to
take him into the house to lay him before Jesus.<br/>
19 When they
could not find a way to do this because of the crowd, they went up on
the roof and lowered him on his mat through the tiles into the middle
of the crowd, right in front of Jesus.</p>
<p>20 When Jesus saw their faith, he said, “Friend, your sins are
forgiven.”</p>
<p>21 The Pharisees and the teachers of the law began thinking to
themselves, “Who is this fellow who speaks blasphemy? Who can
forgive sins but God alone?”</p>
<p>22 Jesus knew what they were thinking and asked, “Why are you
thinking these things in your hearts?<br/>
23 Which is easier: to
say, ‘Your sins are forgiven,’ or to say, ‘Get up and walk’?<br/>
24
But I want you to know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to
forgive sins.” So he said to the paralyzed man, “I tell you, get
up, take your mat and go home.”</p>
<p>25 Immediately he stood up in front of them, took what he had been
lying on and went home praising God.<br/>
26 Everyone was amazed and
gave praise to God. They were filled with awe and said, “We have
seen remarkable things today.”</p>
<hr/>

<h3><strong>Luke 5:27–32</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Jesus Calls Levi and Eats With Sinners</strong></p>
<p>27 After this, Jesus went out and saw a tax collector by the name
of Levi sitting at his tax booth. “Follow me,” Jesus said to
him,<br/>
28 and Levi got up, left everything and followed him.</p>
<p>29 Then Levi held a great banquet for Jesus at his house, and a
large crowd of tax collectors and others were eating with them.<br/>
30
But the Pharisees and the teachers of the law who belonged to their
sect complained to his disciples, “Why do you eat and drink with
tax collectors and sinners?”</p>
<p>31 Jesus answered them, “It is not the healthy who need a
doctor, but the sick.<br/>
32 I have not come to call the righteous,
but sinners to repentance.”</p>
<hr/>

<h3><strong>Luke 5:33–39</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Jesus Questioned About Fasting</strong></p>
<p>33 They said to him, “John’s disciples often fast and pray,
and so do the disciples of the Pharisees, but yours go on eating and
drinking.”</p>
<p>34 Jesus answered, “Can you make the friends of the bridegroom
fast while he is with them?<br/>
35 But the time will come when the
bridegroom will be taken from them; in those days they will fast.”</p>
<p>36 He told them this parable: “No one tears a piece out of a new
garment to patch an old one. Otherwise, they will have torn the new
garment, and the patch from the new will not match the old.<br/>
37
And no one pours new wine into old wineskins. Otherwise, the new wine
will burst the skins; the wine will run out and the wineskins will be
ruined.<br/>
38 No, new wine must be poured into new wineskins.<br/>
39
And no one after drinking old wine wants the new, for they say, ‘The
old is better.’”</p>

<h3><strong>Luke 6:1–11</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Jesus Is Lord of the Sabbath</strong></p>
<p>1 One Sabbath Jesus was going through the grainfields, and his
disciples began to pick some heads of grain, rub them in their hands
and eat the kernels.<br/>
2 Some of the Pharisees asked, “Why are
you doing what is unlawful on the Sabbath?”</p>
<p>3 Jesus answered them, “Have you never read what David did when
he and his companions were hungry?<br/>
4 He entered the house of
God, and taking the consecrated bread, he ate what is lawful only for
priests to eat. And he also gave some to his companions.”</p>
<p>5 Then Jesus said to them, “The Son of Man is Lord of the
Sabbath.”</p>
<p>6 On another Sabbath he went into the synagogue and was teaching,
and a man was there whose right hand was shriveled.<br/>
7 The
Pharisees and the teachers of the law were looking for a reason to
accuse Jesus, so they watched him closely to see if he would heal on
the Sabbath.<br/>
8 But Jesus knew what they were thinking and said
to the man with the shriveled hand, “Get up and stand in front of
everyone.” So he got up and stood there.</p>
<p>9 Then Jesus said to them, “I ask you, which is lawful on the
Sabbath: to do good or to do evil, to save life or to destroy it?”<br/>
10
He looked around at them all, and then said to the man, “Stretch
out your hand.” He did so, and his hand was completely restored.<br/>
11
But the Pharisees and the teachers of the law were furious and began
to discuss with one another what they might do to Jesus.</p>

<h3><strong>Luke 6:12–16</strong></h3>
<p><strong>The Twelve Apostles</strong></p>
<p>12 One of those days Jesus went out to a mountainside to pray, and
spent the night praying to God.<br/>
13 When morning came, he called
his disciples to him and chose twelve of them, whom he also
designated apostles:<br/>
14 Simon (whom he named Peter), his brother
Andrew, James, John, Philip, Bartholomew,<br/>
15 Matthew, Thomas,
James son of Alphaeus, Simon who was called the Zealot,<br/>
16 Judas
son of James, and Judas Iscariot, who became a traitor.</p>
<hr/>

<h3><strong>Luke 6:17–26</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Blessings and Woes</strong></p>
<p>17 He went down with them and stood on a level place. A large
crowd of his disciples was there, and a great number of people from
all over Judea, from Jerusalem, and from the coastal region around
Tyre and Sidon,<br/>
18 who had come to hear him and to be healed of
their diseases. Those troubled by impure spirits were cured,<br/>
19
and the people all tried to touch him, because power was coming from
him and healing them all.</p>
<p>20 Looking at his disciples, he said:<br/>
“Blessed are you who
are poor,<br/>
for yours is the kingdom of God.<br/>
21 Blessed are
you who hunger now,<br/>
for you will be satisfied.<br/>
Blessed are
you who weep now,<br/>
for you will laugh.<br/>
22 Blessed are you
when people hate you,<br/>
when they exclude you and insult you<br/>
and
reject your name as evil,<br/>
because of the Son of Man.</p>
<p>23 “Rejoice in that day and leap for joy, because great is your
reward in heaven. For that is how their ancestors treated the
prophets.</p>
<p>24 “But woe to you who are rich,<br/>
for you have already
received your comfort.<br/>
25 Woe to you who are well fed now,<br/>
for
you will go hungry.<br/>
Woe to you who laugh now,<br/>
for you will
mourn and weep.<br/>
26 Woe to you when everyone speaks well of
you,<br/>
for that is how their ancestors treated the false prophets.</p>

<h3><strong>Luke 6:27–36</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Love for Enemies</strong></p>
<p>27 “But to you who are listening I say: Love your enemies, do
good to those who hate you,<br/>
28 bless those who curse you, pray
for those who mistreat you.<br/>
29 If someone slaps you on one
cheek, turn to them the other also. If someone takes your coat, do
not withhold your shirt.<br/>
30 Give to everyone who asks you, and
if anyone takes what belongs to you, do not demand it back.<br/>
31
Do to others as you would have them do to you.</p>
<p>32 “If you love those who love you, what credit is that to you?
Even sinners love those who love them.<br/>
33 And if you do good to
those who are good to you, what credit is that to you? Even sinners
do that.<br/>
34 And if you lend to those from whom you expect
repayment, what credit is that to you? Even sinners lend to sinners,
expecting to be repaid in full.<br/>
35 But love your enemies, do
good to them, and lend to them without expecting to get anything
back. Then your reward will be great, and you will be children of the
Most High, because he is kind to the ungrateful and wicked.<br/>
36
Be merciful, just as your Father is merciful.</p>

<h3><strong>Luke 6:37–42</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Judging Others</strong></p>
<p>37 “Do not judge, and you will not be judged. Do not condemn,
and you will not be condemned. Forgive, and you will be forgiven.<br/>
38
Give, and it will be given to you. A good measure, pressed down,
shaken together and running over, will be poured into your lap. For
with the measure you use, it will be measured to you.”</p>
<p>39 He also told them this parable: “Can the blind lead the
blind? Will they not both fall into a pit?<br/>
40 The student is not
above the teacher, but everyone who is fully trained will be like
their teacher.</p>
<p>41 “Why do you look at the speck of sawdust in your brother’s
eye and pay no attention to the plank in your own eye?<br/>
42 How
can you say to your brother, ‘Brother, let me take the speck out of
your eye,’ when you yourself fail to see the plank in your own eye?
You hypocrite, first take the plank out of your eye, and then you
will see clearly to remove the speck from your brother’s eye.</p>

<h3><strong>Luke 7:1–10</strong></h3>
<p><strong>The Faith of the Centurion</strong></p>
<p>1 When Jesus had finished saying all this to the people who were
listening, he entered Capernaum.<br/>
2 There a centurion’s
servant, whom his master valued highly, was sick and about to die.<br/>
3
The centurion heard of Jesus and sent some elders of the Jews to him,
asking him to come and heal his servant.<br/>
4 When they came to
Jesus, they pleaded earnestly with him, “This man deserves to have
you do this,<br/>
5 because he loves our nation and has built our
synagogue.”<br/>
6 So Jesus went with them.</p>
<p>He was not far from the house when the centurion sent friends to
say to him: “Lord, don’t trouble yourself, for I do not deserve
to have you come under my roof.<br/>
7 That is why I did not even
consider myself worthy to come to you. But say the word, and my
servant will be healed.<br/>
8 For I myself am a man under authority,
with soldiers under me. I tell this one, ‘Go,’ and he goes; and
that one, ‘Come,’ and he comes. I say to my servant, ‘Do this,’
and he does it.”</p>
<p>9 When Jesus heard this, he was amazed at him, and turning to the
crowd following him, he said, “I tell you, I have not found such
great faith even in Israel.”<br/>
10 Then the men who had been sent
returned to the house and found the servant well.</p>

<h3><strong>Luke 7:11–17</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Jesus Raises a Widow’s Son</strong></p>
<p>11 Soon afterward, Jesus went to a town called Nain, and his
disciples and a large crowd went along with him.<br/>
12 As he
approached the town gate, a dead person was being carried out—the
only son of his mother, and she was a widow. And a large crowd from
the town was with her.<br/>
13 When the Lord saw her, his heart went
out to her and he said, “Don’t cry.”</p>
<p>14 Then he went up and touched the bier they were carrying him on,
and the bearers stood still. He said, “Young man, I say to you, get
up!”<br/>
15 The dead man sat up and began to talk, and Jesus gave
him back to his mother.</p>
<p>16 They were all filled with awe and praised God. “A great
prophet has appeared among us,” they said. “God has come to help
his people.”<br/>
17 This news about Jesus spread throughout Judea
and the surrounding country.</p>

of them,<br/>
19 he sent them to the Lord to ask, “Are you the one
who is to come, or should we expect someone else?”</p>
<p>20 When the men came to Jesus, they said, “John the Baptist sent
us to you to ask, ‘Are you the one who is to come, or should we
expect someone else?’”</p>
<p>21 At that very time Jesus cured many who had diseases, sicknesses
and evil spirits, and gave sight to many who were blind.<br/>
22 So
he replied to the messengers, “Go back and report to John what you
have seen and heard:<br/>
The blind receive sight, the lame
walk,<br/>
those who have leprosy are cleansed, the deaf hear,<br/>
the
dead are raised, and the good news is proclaimed to the poor.<br/>
23
Blessed is anyone who does not stumble on account of me.”</p>
<p>24 After John’s messengers left, Jesus began to speak to the
crowd about John: “What did you go out into the wilderness to see?
A reed swayed by the wind?<br/>
25 If not, what did you go out to
see? A man dressed in fine clothes? No, those who wear expensive
clothes and indulge in luxury are in palaces.<br/>
26 But what did
you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, and more than a
prophet.<br/>
27 This is the one about whom it is written:<br/>
“‘I
will send my messenger ahead of you,<br/>
who will prepare your way
before you.’</p>
<p>28 I tell you, among those born of women there is no one greater
than John; yet the one who is least in the kingdom of God is greater
than he.”</p>
<p>29 (All the people, even the tax collectors, when they heard
Jesus’ words, acknowledged that God’s way was right, because they
had been baptized by John.<br/>
30 But the Pharisees and the experts
in the law rejected God’s purpose for themselves, because they had
not been baptized by John.)</p>
<p>31 Jesus went on to say, “To what, then, can I compare the
people of this generation? What are they like?<br/>
32 They are like
children sitting in the marketplace and calling out to each
other:<br/>
“‘We played the pipe for you,<br/>
and you did not
dance;<br/>
we sang a dirge,<br/>
and you did not cry.’</p>
<p>33 For John the Baptist came neither eating bread nor drinking
wine, and you say, ‘He has a demon.’<br/>
34 The Son of Man came
eating and drinking, and you say, ‘Here is a glutton and a
drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners.’<br/>
35 But
wisdom is proved right by all her children.”</p>

<h3><strong>Luke 7:36–50</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Jesus Anointed by a Sinful Woman</strong></p>
<p>36 When one of the Pharisees invited Jesus to have dinner with
him, he went to the Pharisee’s house and reclined at the table.<br/>
37
A woman in that town who lived a sinful life learned that Jesus was
eating at the Pharisee’s house, so she came there with an alabaster
jar of perfume.<br/>
38 As she stood behind him at his feet weeping,
she began to wet his feet with her tears. Then she wiped them with
her hair, kissed them and poured perfume on them.</p>
<p>39 When the Pharisee who had invited him saw this, he said to
himself, “If this man were a prophet, he would know who is touching
him and what kind of woman she is—that she is a sinner.”</p>
<p>40 Jesus answered him, “Simon, I have something to tell
you.”<br/>
“Tell me, teacher,” he said.</p>
<p>41 “Two people owed money to a certain moneylender. One owed him
five hundred denarii, and the other fifty.<br/>
42 Neither of them
had the money to pay him back, so he forgave the debts of both. Now
which of them will love him more?”</p>
<p>43 Simon replied, “I suppose the one who had the bigger debt
forgiven.”<br/>
“You have judged correctly,” Jesus said.</p>
<p>44 Then he turned toward the woman and said to Simon, “Do you
see this woman? I came into your house. You did not give me any water
for my feet, but she wet my feet with her tears and wiped them with
her hair.<br/>
45 You did not give me a kiss, but this woman, from
the time I entered, has not stopped kissing my feet.<br/>
46 You did
not put oil on my head, but she has poured perfume on my feet.<br/>
47
Therefore, I tell you, her many sins have been forgiven—as her
great love has shown. But whoever has been forgiven little loves
little.”</p>
<p>48 Then Jesus said to her, “Your sins are forgiven.”</p>
<p>49 The other guests began to say among themselves, “Who is this
who even forgives sins?”</p>
<p>50 Jesus said to the woman, “Your faith has saved you; go in
peace.”</p>

<h3><strong>Luke 8:1–3</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Jesus Travels and Proclaims the Good News</strong></p>
<p>1 After this, Jesus traveled about from one town and village to
another, proclaiming the good news of the kingdom of God. The Twelve
were with him,<br/>
2 and also some women who had been cured of evil
spirits and diseases: Mary (called Magdalene) from whom seven demons
had come out;<br/>
3 Joanna the wife of Chuza, the manager of Herod’s
household; Susanna; and many others. These women were helping to
support them out of their own means.</p>
<hr/>

<h3><strong>Luke 8:4–15</strong></h3>
<p><strong>The Parable of the Sower</strong></p>
<p>4 While a large crowd was gathering and people were coming to
Jesus from town after town, he told this parable:<br/>
5 “A farmer
went out to sow his seed. As he was scattering the seed, some fell
along the path; it was trampled on, and the birds ate it up.<br/>
6
Some fell on rocky ground, and when it came up, the plants withered
because they had no moisture.<br/>
7 Other seed fell among thorns,
which grew up with it and choked the plants.<br/>
8 Still other seed
fell on good soil. It came up and yielded a crop, a hundred times
more than was sown.”</p>
<p>When he said this, he called out, “Whoever has ears to hear, let
them hear.”</p>
<p>9 His disciples asked him what this parable meant.<br/>
10 He
said, “The knowledge of the secrets of the kingdom of God has been
given to you, but to others I speak in parables, so that,<br/>
“‘though
seeing, they may not see;<br/>
though hearing, they may not
understand.’</p>
<p>11 “This is the meaning of the parable: The seed is the word of
God.<br/>
12 Those along the path are the ones who hear, and then the
devil comes and takes away the word from their hearts, so that they
may not believe and be saved.<br/>
13 Those on the rocky ground are
the ones who receive the word with joy when they hear it, but they
have no root. They believe for a while, but in the time of testing
they fall away.<br/>
14 The seed that fell among thorns stands for
those who hear, but as they go on their way they are choked by life’s
worries, riches, and pleasures, and they do not mature.<br/>
15 But
the seed on good soil stands for those with a noble and good heart,
who hear the word, retain it, and by persevering produce a crop.</p>
<hr/>

<h3><strong>Luke 8:16–18</strong></h3>
<p><strong>A Lamp on a Stand</strong></p>
<p>16 “No one lights a lamp and hides it in a clay jar or puts it
under a bed. Instead, they put it on a stand, so that those who come
in can see the light.<br/>
17 For there is nothing hidden that will
not be disclosed, and nothing concealed that will not be known or
brought out into the open.<br/>
18 Therefore consider carefully how
you listen. Whoever has will be given more; whoever does not have,
even what they think they have will be taken from them.”</p>
<hr/>

<h3><strong>Luke 8:19–21</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Jesus’ Mother and Brothers</strong></p>
<p>19 Now Jesus’ mother and brothers came to see him, but they were
not able to get near him because of the crowd.<br/>
20 Someone told
him, “Your mother and brothers are standing outside, wanting to see
you.”</p>
<p>21 He replied, “My mother and brothers are those who hear God’s
word and put it into practice.”</p>
<hr/>

<h3><strong>Luke 8:22–25</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Jesus Calms the Storm</strong></p>
<p>22 One day Jesus said to his disciples, “Let us go over to the
other side of the lake.” So they got into a boat and set out.<br/>
23
As they sailed, he fell asleep. A squall came down on the lake, so
that the boat was being swamped, and they were in great danger.</p>
<p>24 The disciples went and woke him, saying, “Master, Master,
we’re going to drown!”</p>
<p>He got up and rebuked the wind and the raging waters; the storm
subsided, and all was calm.<br/>
25 “Where is your faith?” he
asked his disciples.</p>
<p>In fear and amazement they asked one another, “Who is this? He
commands even the winds and the water, and they obey him.”</p>
<hr/>

<h3><strong>Luke 8:26–39</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Jesus Restores a Demon-Possessed Man</strong></p>
<p>26 They sailed to the region of the Gerasenes, which is across the
lake from Galilee.<br/>
27 When Jesus stepped ashore, he was met by a
demon-possessed man from the town. For a long time this man had not
worn clothes or lived in a house, but had lived in the tombs.<br/>
28
When he saw Jesus, he cried out and fell at his feet, shouting at the
top of his voice, “What do you want with me, Jesus, Son of the Most
High God? I beg you, don’t torture me!”<br/>
29 For Jesus had
commanded the impure spirit to come out of the man. Many times it had
seized him, and though he was chained hand and foot and kept under
guard, he had broken his chains and had been driven by the demon into
solitary places.</p>
<p>30 Jesus asked him, “What is your name?”<br/>
“Legion,” he
replied, because many demons had gone into him.<br/>
31 And they
begged Jesus repeatedly not to order them to go into the Abyss.</p>
<p>32 A large herd of pigs was feeding there on the hillside. The
demons begged Jesus to let them go into the pigs, and he gave them
permission.<br/>
33 When the demons came out of the man, they went
into the pigs, and the herd rushed down the steep bank into the lake
and was drowned.</p>
<p>34 When those tending the pigs saw what had happened, they ran off
and reported this in the town and countryside,<br/>
35 and the people
went out to see what had happened. When they came to Jesus, they
found the man from whom the demons had gone out, sitting at Jesus’
feet, dressed and in his right mind; and they were afraid.<br/>
36
Those who had seen it told the people how the demon-possessed man had
been cured.<br/>
37 Then all the people of the region of the
Gerasenes asked Jesus to leave them, because they were overcome with
fear. So he got into the boat and left.</p>
<p>38 The man from whom the demons had gone out begged to go with
him, but Jesus sent him away, saying,<br/>
39 “Return home and tell
how much God has done for you.” So the man went away and told all
over town how much Jesus had done for him.</p>
<hr/>

<h3><strong>Luke 8:40–56</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Jesus Raises a Dead Girl and Heals a Sick Woman</strong></p>
<p>40 Now when Jesus returned, a crowd welcomed him, for they were
all expecting him.<br/>
41 Then a man named Jairus, a synagogue
leader, came and fell at Jesus’ feet, pleading with him to come to
his house<br/>
42 because his only daughter, a girl of about twelve,
was dying.</p>
<p>As Jesus was on his way, the crowds almost crushed him.<br/>
43
And a woman was there who had been subject to bleeding for twelve
years, but no one could heal her.<br/>
44 She came up behind him and
touched the edge of his cloak, and immediately her bleeding stopped.</p>
<p>45 “Who touched me?” Jesus asked.</p>
<p>When they all denied it, Peter said, “Master, the people are
crowding and pressing against you.”</p>
<p>46 But Jesus said, “Someone touched me; I know that power has
gone out from me.”<br/>
47 Then the woman, seeing that she could
not go unnoticed, came trembling and fell at his feet. In the
presence of all the people, she told why she had touched him and how
she had been instantly healed.<br/>
48 Then he said to her,
“Daughter, your faith has healed you. Go in peace.”</p>
<p>49 While Jesus was still speaking, someone came from the house of
Jairus, the synagogue leader. “Your daughter is dead,” he said.
“Don’t bother the teacher anymore.”</p>
<p>50 Hearing this, Jesus said to Jairus, “Don’t be afraid; just
believe, and she will be healed.”</p>
<p>51 When he arrived at the house of Jairus, he did not let anyone
go in with him except Peter, John, and James, and the child’s
father and mother.<br/>
52 Meanwhile, all the people were wailing and
mourning for her. “Stop wailing,” Jesus said. “She is not dead
but asleep.”</p>
<p>53 They laughed at him, knowing that she was dead.<br/>
54 But he
took her by the hand and said, “My child, get up!”<br/>
55 Her
spirit returned, and at once she stood up. Then Jesus told them to
give her something to eat.<br/>
56 Her parents were astonished, but
he ordered them not to tell anyone what had happened.</p>
<hr/>

<h3><strong>Luke 9:1–6</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Jesus Sends Out the Twelve</strong></p>
<p>1 When Jesus had called the Twelve together, he gave them power
and authority to drive out all demons and to cure diseases,<br/>
2
and he sent them out to proclaim the kingdom of God and to heal the
sick.<br/>
3 He told them: “Take nothing for the journey—no
staff, no bag, no bread, no money, no extra shirt.<br/>
4 Whatever
house you enter, stay there until you leave that town.<br/>
5 If
people do not welcome you, leave their town and shake the dust off
your feet as a testimony against them.”<br/>
6 So they set out and
went from village to village, proclaiming the good news and healing
people everywhere.</p>
<hr/>

<h3><strong>Luke 9:7–9</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Herod’s Perplexity</strong></p>
<p>7 Now Herod the tetrarch heard about all that was going on. And he
was perplexed because some were saying that John had been raised from
the dead,<br/>
8 others that Elijah had appeared, and still others
that one of the prophets of long ago had come back to life.<br/>
9
But Herod said, “I beheaded John. Who, then, is this I hear such
things about?” And he tried to see him.</p>
<hr/>

<h3><strong>Luke 9:10–17</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Jesus Feeds the Five Thousand</strong></p>
<p>10 When the apostles returned, they reported to Jesus what they
had done. Then he took them with him, and they withdrew by themselves
to a town called Bethsaida,<br/>
11 but the crowds learned about it
and followed him. He welcomed them and spoke to them about the
kingdom of God, and healed those who needed healing.</p>
<p>12 Late in the afternoon the Twelve came to him and said, “Send
the crowd away so they can go to the surrounding villages and
countryside and find food and lodging, because we are in a remote
place here.”</p>
<p>13 He replied, “You give them something to eat.”</p>
<p>They answered, “We have only five loaves of bread and two
fish—unless we go and buy food for all this crowd.”<br/>
14
(About five thousand men were there.)</p>
<p>But he said to his disciples, “Have them sit down in groups of
about fifty each.”<br/>
15 The disciples did so, and everyone sat
down.<br/>
16 Taking the five loaves and the two fish and looking up
to heaven, he gave thanks and broke them. Then he gave them to the
disciples to distribute to the people.<br/>
17 They all ate and were
satisfied, and the disciples picked up twelve basketfuls of broken
pieces that were left over.</p>
<hr/>

<h3><strong>Luke 9:18–20</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Peter Declares That Jesus Is the Messiah</strong></p>
<p>18 Once when Jesus was praying in private and his disciples were
with him, he asked them, “Who do the crowds say I am?”</p>
<p>19 They replied, “Some say John the Baptist; others say Elijah;
and still others, that one of the prophets of long ago has come back
to life.”</p>
<p>20 “But what about you?” he asked. “Who do you say I
am?”<br/>
Peter answered, “God’s Messiah.”</p>
<hr/>

<h3><strong>Luke 9:21–27</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Jesus Predicts His Death</strong></p>
<p>21 Jesus strictly warned them not to tell this to anyone.<br/>
22
And he said, “The Son of Man must suffer many things and be
rejected by the elders, the chief priests and the teachers of the
law, and he must be killed and on the third day be raised to life.”</p>
<p>23 Then he said to them all: “Whoever wants to be my disciple
must deny themselves and take up their cross daily and follow me.<br/>
24
For whoever wants to save their life will lose it, but whoever loses
their life for me will save it.<br/>
25 What good is it for someone
to gain the whole world, and yet lose or forfeit their very self?<br/>
26
Whoever is ashamed of me and my words, the Son of Man will be ashamed
of them when he comes in his glory and in the glory of the Father and
of the holy angels.<br/>
27 Truly I tell you, some who are standing
here will not taste death before they see the kingdom of God.”</p>

<h3><strong>Luke 9:28–36</strong></h3>
<p><strong>The Transfiguration</strong></p>
<p>28 About eight days after Jesus said this, he took Peter, John,
and James with him and went up onto a mountain to pray.<br/>
29 As he
was praying, the appearance of his face changed, and his clothes
became as bright as a flash of lightning.<br/>
30 Two men, Moses and
Elijah, appeared in glorious splendor, talking with Jesus.<br/>
31
They spoke about his departure, which he was about to bring to
fulfillment at Jerusalem.</p>
<p>32 Peter and his companions were very sleepy, but when they became
fully awake, they saw his glory and the two men standing with him.<br/>
33
As the men were leaving Jesus, Peter said to him, “Master, it is
good for us to be here. Let us put up three shelters—one for you,
one for Moses, and one for Elijah.” (He did not know what he was
saying.)</p>
<p>34 While he was speaking, a cloud appeared and covered them, and
they were afraid as they entered the cloud.<br/>
35 A voice came from
the cloud, saying, “This is my Son, whom I have chosen; listen to
him.”<br/>
36 When the voice had spoken, they found that Jesus was
alone. The disciples kept this to themselves and did not tell anyone
at that time what they had seen.</p>
<hr/>

<h3><strong>Luke 9:37–43a</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Jesus Heals a Demon-Possessed Boy</strong></p>
<p>37 The next day, when they came down from the mountain, a large
crowd met him.<br/>
38 A man in the crowd called out, “Teacher, I
beg you to look at my son, for he is my only child.<br/>
39 A spirit
seizes him and he suddenly screams; it throws him into convulsions so
that he foams at the mouth. It scarcely ever leaves him and is
destroying him.<br/>
40 I begged your disciples to drive it out, but
they could not.”</p>
<p>41 “You unbelieving and perverse generation,” Jesus replied,
“How long shall I stay with you and put up with you? Bring your son
here.”</p>
<p>42 Even while the boy was coming, the demon threw him to the
ground in a convulsion. But Jesus rebuked the impure spirit, healed
the boy, and gave him back to his father.<br/>
43 And they were all
amazed at the greatness of God.</p>
<hr/>

<h3><strong>Luke 9:43b–50</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Jesus Predicts His Death a Second Time</strong></p>
<p>43 While everyone was marveling at all that Jesus did, he said to
his disciples,<br/>
44 “Listen carefully to what I am about to tell
you: The Son of Man is going to be delivered into the hands of
men.”<br/>
45 But they did not understand what this meant. It was
hidden from them, so that they did not grasp it, and they were afraid
to ask him about it.</p>
<p><strong>An Argument Among the Disciples</strong></p>
<p>46 An argument started among the disciples as to which of them
would be the greatest.<br/>
47 Jesus, knowing their thoughts, took a
little child and had him stand beside him.<br/>
48 Then he said to
them, “Whoever welcomes this little child in my name welcomes me;
and whoever welcomes me welcomes the one who sent me. For it is the
one who is least among you all who is the greatest.”</p>
<p><strong>Whoever Is Not Against You Is for You</strong></p>
<p>49 “Master,” said John, “we saw someone driving out demons
in your name and we tried to stop him, because he is not one of
us.”<br/>
50 “Do not stop him,” Jesus said, “for whoever is
not against you is for you.”</p>
<hr/>

<h3><strong>Luke 9:51–56</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Samaritan Opposition</strong></p>
<p>51 As the time approached for him to be taken up to heaven, Jesus
resolutely set out for Jerusalem.<br/>
52 And he sent messengers on
ahead, who went into a Samaritan village to get things ready for
him;<br/>
53 but the people there did not welcome him, because he was
heading for Jerusalem.<br/>
54 When the disciples James and John saw
this, they asked, “Lord, do you want us to call fire down from
heaven to destroy them?”<br/>
55 But Jesus turned and rebuked
them.<br/>
56 Then he and his disciples went to another village.</p>
<hr/>

<h3><strong>Luke 9:57–62</strong></h3>
<p><strong>The Cost of Following Jesus</strong></p>
<p>57 As they were walking along the road, a man said to him, “I
will follow you wherever you go.”</p>
<p>58 Jesus replied, “Foxes have dens and birds have nests, but the
Son of Man has no place to lay his head.”</p>
<p>59 He said to another man, “Follow me.”<br/>
But he replied,
“Lord, first let me go and bury my father.”</p>
<p>60 Jesus said to him, “Let the dead bury their own dead, but you
go and proclaim the kingdom of God.”</p>
<p>61 Still another said, “I will follow you, Lord; but first let
me go back and say goodbye to my family.”</p>
<p>62 Jesus replied, “No one who puts a hand to the plow and looks
back is fit for service in the kingdom of God.”</p>
<hr/>

<h3><strong>Luke 10:1–12</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Jesus Sends Out the Seventy-Two</strong></p>
<p>1 After this, the Lord appointed seventy-two others and sent them
two by two ahead of him to every town and place where he was about to
go.<br/>
2 He told them, “The harvest is plentiful, but the workers
are few. Ask the Lord of the harvest, therefore, to send out workers
into his harvest field.<br/>
3 Go! I am sending you out like lambs
among wolves.<br/>
4 Do not take a purse or bag or sandals; and do
not greet anyone on the road.</p>
<p>5 “When you enter a house, first say, ‘Peace to this house.’<br/>
6
If someone who promotes peace is there, your peace will rest on them;
if not, it will return to you.<br/>
7 Stay there, eating and drinking
whatever they give you, for the worker deserves his wages. Do not
move around from house to house.</p>
<p>8 “When you enter a town and are welcomed, eat what is offered
to you.<br/>
9 Heal the sick who are there and tell them, ‘The
kingdom of God has come near to you.’<br/>
10 But when you enter a
town and are not welcomed, go into its streets and say,<br/>
11 ‘Even
the dust of your town we wipe from our feet as a warning to you. Yet
be sure of this: The kingdom of God has come near.’<br/>
12 I tell
you, it will be more bearable on that day for Sodom than for that
town.</p>
<hr/>

<h3><strong>Luke 10:13–16</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Woe on Unrepentant Towns</strong></p>
<p>13 “Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the
miracles that were performed in you had been performed in Tyre and
Sidon, they would have repented long ago, sitting in sackcloth and
ashes.<br/>
14 But it will be more bearable for Tyre and Sidon at the
judgment than for you.<br/>
15 And you, Capernaum, will you be lifted
to the heavens? No, you will go down to Hades.</p>
<p>16 “Whoever listens to you listens to me; whoever rejects you
rejects me; but whoever rejects me rejects him who sent me.”</p>
<hr/>

<h3><strong>Luke 10:17–24</strong></h3>
<p><strong>The Return of the Seventy-Two</strong></p>
<p>17 The seventy-two returned with joy and said, “Lord, even the
demons submit to us in your name.”</p>
<p>18 He replied, “I saw Satan fall like lightning from heaven.<br/>
19
I have given you authority to trample on snakes and scorpions and to
overcome all the power of the enemy; nothing will harm you.<br/>

However, do not rejoice that the spirits submit to you, but rejoice
that your names are written in heaven.”</p>
<p>21 At that time Jesus, full of joy through the Holy Spirit, said,
“I praise you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because you have
hidden these things from the wise and learned, and revealed them to
little children. Yes, Father, for this is what you were pleased to
do.</p>
<p>22 “All things have been committed to me by my Father. No one
knows who the Son is except the Father, and no one knows who the
Father is except the Son and those to whom the Son chooses to reveal
him.”</p>
<p>23 Then he turned to his disciples and said privately, “Blessed
are the eyes that see what you see.<br/>
24 For I tell you that many
prophets and kings wanted to see what you see but did not see it, and
to hear what you hear but did not hear it.”</p>

<h3><strong>Luke 10:25–37</strong></h3>
<p><strong>The Parable of the Good Samaritan</strong></p>
<p>25 On one occasion an expert in the law stood up to test Jesus.
“Teacher,” he asked, “what must I do to inherit eternal life?”</p>
<p>26 “What is written in the Law?” he replied. “How do you
read it?”</p>
<p>27 He answered, “‘Love the Lord your God with all your heart
and with all your soul and with all your strength and with all your
mind’; and, ‘Love your neighbor as yourself.’”</p>
<p>28 “You have answered correctly,” Jesus replied. “Do this
and you will live.”</p>
<p>29 But he wanted to justify himself, so he asked Jesus, “And who
is my neighbor?”</p>
<p>30 In reply Jesus said: “A man was going down from Jerusalem to
Jericho, when he was attacked by robbers. They stripped him of his
clothes, beat him and went away, leaving him half dead.<br/>
31 A
priest happened to be going down the same road, and when he saw the
man, he passed by on the other side.<br/>
32 So too, a Levite, when
he came to the place and saw him, passed by on the other side.<br/>
33
But a Samaritan, as he traveled, came where the man was; and when he
saw him, he took pity on him.<br/>
34 He went to him and bandaged his
wounds, pouring on oil and wine. Then he put the man on his own
donkey, brought him to an inn, and took care of him.<br/>
35 The next
day he took out two denarii and gave them to the innkeeper. ‘Look
after him,’ he said, ‘and when I return, I will reimburse you for
any extra expense you may have.’</p>
<p>36 “Which of these three do you think was a neighbor to the man
who fell into the hands of robbers?”</p>
<p>37 The expert in the law replied, “The one who had mercy on
him.”<br/>
Jesus told him, “Go and do likewise.”</p>

<h3><strong>Luke 10:38–42</strong></h3>
<p><strong>At the Home of Martha and Mary</strong></p>
<p>38 As Jesus and his disciples were on their way, he came to a
village where a woman named Martha opened her home to him.<br/>
39
She had a sister called Mary, who sat at the Lord’s feet listening
to what he said.<br/>
40 But Martha was distracted by all the
preparations that had to be made. She came to him and asked, “Lord,
don’t you care that my sister has left me to do the work by myself?
Tell her to help me!”</p>
<p>41 “Martha, Martha,” the Lord answered, “you are worried and
upset about many things,<br/>
42 but few things are needed—or
indeed only one. Mary has chosen what is better, and it will not be
taken away from her.”</p>

<h3><strong>Luke 11:1–13</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Jesus Teaches About Prayer</strong></p>
<p>1 One day Jesus was praying in a certain place. When he finished,
one of his disciples said to him, “Lord, teach us to pray, just as
John taught his disciples.”</p>
<p>2 He said to them, “When you pray, say:</p>
<p>“‘Father,<br/>
hallowed be your name,<br/>
your kingdom
come.<br/>
3 Give us each day our daily bread.<br/>
4 Forgive us our
sins,<br/>
for we also forgive everyone who sins against us.<br/>
And
lead us not into temptation.’”</p>
<p><strong>Persistence in Prayer</strong></p>
<p>5 Then Jesus said to them, “Suppose you have a friend, and you
go to him at midnight and say, ‘Friend, lend me three loaves of
bread;<br/>
6 a friend of mine on a journey has come to me, and I
have no food to offer him.’<br/>
7 And suppose the one inside
answers, ‘Don’t bother me. The door is already locked, and my
children and I are in bed. I can’t get up and give you anything.’<br/>
8
I tell you, even though he will not get up and give you the bread
because of friendship, yet because of your shameless audacity he will
surely get up and give you as much as you need.</p>
<p>9 “So I say to you: Ask and it will be given to you; seek and
you will find; knock and the door will be opened to you.<br/>
10 For
everyone who asks receives; the one who seeks finds; and to the one
who knocks, the door will be opened.</p>
<p>11 “Which of you fathers, if your son asks for a fish, will give
him a snake instead?<br/>
12 Or if he asks for an egg, will give him
a scorpion?<br/>
13 If you then, though you are evil, know how to
give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father in
heaven give the Holy Spirit to those who ask him!”</p>
<hr/>

<h3><strong>Luke 11:14–28</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Jesus and Beelzebul</strong></p>
<p>14 Jesus was driving out a demon that was mute. When the demon
left, the man who had been mute spoke, and the crowd was amazed.<br/>
15
But some of them said, “By Beelzebul, the prince of demons, he is
driving out demons.”<br/>
16 Others tested him by asking for a sign
from heaven.</p>
<p>17 Jesus knew their thoughts and said to them: “Any kingdom
divided against itself will be ruined, and a house divided against
itself will fall.<br/>
18 If Satan is divided against himself, how
can his kingdom stand? I say this because you claim that I drive out
demons by Beelzebul.<br/>
19 Now if I drive out demons by Beelzebul,
by whom do your followers drive them out? So then, they will be your
judges.<br/>
20 But if I drive out demons by the finger of God, then
the kingdom of God has come upon you.</p>
<p>21 “When a strong man, fully armed, guards his own house, his
possessions are safe.<br/>
22 But when someone stronger attacks and
overpowers him, he takes away the armor in which the man trusted and
divides up his plunder.</p>
<p>23 “Whoever is not with me is against me, and whoever does not
gather with me scatters.</p>
<p><strong>The Return of an Impure Spirit</strong></p>
<p>24 “When an impure spirit comes out of a person, it goes through
arid places seeking rest and does not find it. Then it says, ‘I
will return to the house I left.’<br/>
25 When it arrives, it finds
the house swept clean and put in order.<br/>
26 Then it goes and
takes seven other spirits more wicked than itself, and they go in and
live there. And the final condition of that person is worse than the
first.”</p>
<p><strong>Blessed Rather Are Those Who Hear the Word of God</strong></p>
<p>27 As Jesus was saying these things, a woman in the crowd called
out, “Blessed is the mother who gave you birth and nursed you.”</p>
<p>28 He replied, “Blessed rather are those who hear the word of
God and obey it.”</p>

<h3><strong>Luke 11:29–32</strong></h3>
<p><strong>The Sign of Jonah</strong></p>
<p>29 As the crowds increased, Jesus said, “This is a wicked
generation. It asks for a sign, but none will be given it except the
sign of Jonah.<br/>
30 For as Jonah was a sign to the Ninevites, so
also will the Son of Man be to this generation.<br/>
31 The Queen of
the South will rise at the judgment with the people of this
generation and condemn them; for she came from the ends of the earth
to listen to Solomon’s wisdom, and now something greater than
Solomon is here.<br/>
32 The people of Nineveh will stand up at the
judgment with this generation and condemn it; for they repented at
the preaching of Jonah, and now something greater than Jonah is here.</p>

<h3><strong>Luke 11:33–36</strong></h3>
<p><strong>The Lamp of the Body</strong></p>
<p>33 “No one lights a lamp and puts it in a place where it will be
hidden, or under a bowl. Instead, they put it on its stand, so that
those who come in may see the light.<br/>
34 Your eye is the lamp of
your body. When your eyes are healthy, your whole body also is full
of light. But when they are unhealthy, your body also is full of
darkness.<br/>
35 See to it, then, that the light within you is not
darkness.<br/>
36 Therefore, if your whole body is full of light, and
no part of it dark, it will be just as full of light as when a lamp
shines its light on you.”</p>
<hr/>

<h3><strong>Luke 11:37–54</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Woes on the Pharisees and the Experts in the Law</strong></p>
<p>37 When Jesus had finished speaking, a Pharisee invited him to eat
with him; so he went in and reclined at the table.<br/>
38 But the
Pharisee was surprised when he noticed that Jesus did not first wash
before the meal.</p>
<p>39 Then the Lord said to him, “Now then, you Pharisees clean the
outside of the cup and dish, but inside you are full of greed and
wickedness.<br/>
40 You foolish people! Did not the one who made the
outside make the inside also?<br/>
41 But now as for what is inside
you—be generous to the poor, and everything will be clean for you.</p>
<p>42 “Woe to you Pharisees, because you give God a tenth of your
mint, rue, and all other kinds of garden herbs, but you neglect
justice and the love of God. You should have practiced the latter
without leaving the former undone.</p>
<p>43 “Woe to you Pharisees, because you love the most important
seats in the synagogues and respectful greetings in the marketplaces.</p>
<p>44 “Woe to you, because you are like unmarked graves, which
people walk over without knowing it.”</p>
<p>45 One of the experts in the law answered him, “Teacher, when
you say these things, you insult us also.”</p>
<p>46 Jesus replied, “And you experts in the law, woe to you,
because you load people down with burdens they can hardly carry, and
you yourselves will not lift one finger to help them.</p>
<p>47 “Woe to you, because you build tombs for the prophets, and it
was your ancestors who killed them.<br/>
48 So you testify that you
approve of what your ancestors did; they killed the prophets, and you
build their tombs.<br/>
49 Because of this, God in his wisdom said,
‘I will send them prophets and apostles, some of whom they will
kill and others they will persecute.’<br/>
50 Therefore this
generation will be held responsible for the blood of all the prophets
that has been shed since the beginning of the world,<br/>
51 from the
blood of Abel to the blood of Zechariah, who was killed between the
altar and the sanctuary. Yes, I tell you, this generation will be
held responsible for it all.</p>
<p>52 “Woe to you experts in the law, because you have taken away
the key to knowledge. You yourselves have not entered, and you have
hindered those who were entering.”</p>
<p>53 When Jesus went outside, the Pharisees and the teachers of the
law began to oppose him fiercely and to besiege him with
questions,<br/>
54 waiting to catch him in something he might say.</p>
<hr/>

<h3><strong>Luke 12:1–12</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Warnings and Encouragements</strong></p>
<p>1 Meanwhile, when a crowd of many thousands had gathered, so that
they were trampling on one another, Jesus began to speak first to his
disciples, saying: “Be on your guard against the yeast of the
Pharisees, which is hypocrisy.<br/>
2 There is nothing concealed that
will not be disclosed, or hidden that will not be made known.<br/>
3
What you have said in the dark will be heard in the daylight, and
what you have whispered in the ear in the inner rooms will be
proclaimed from the roofs.</p>
<p>4 “I tell you, my friends, do not be afraid of those who kill
the body and after that can do no more.<br/>
5 But I will show you
whom you should fear: Fear him who, after your body has been killed,
has authority to throw you into hell. Yes, I tell you, fear him.<br/>
6
Are not five sparrows sold for two pennies? Yet not one of them is
forgotten by God.<br/>
7 Indeed, the very hairs of your head are all
numbered. Don’t be afraid; you are worth more than many sparrows.</p>
<p>8 “I tell you, whoever publicly acknowledges me before others,
the Son of Man will also acknowledge before the angels of God.<br/>
9
But whoever disowns me before others will be disowned before the
angels of God.<br/>
10 And everyone who speaks a word against the Son
of Man will be forgiven, but anyone who blasphemes against the Holy
Spirit will not be forgiven.</p>
<p>11 “When you are brought before synagogues, rulers, and
authorities, do not worry about how you will defend yourselves or
what you will say,<br/>
12 for the Holy Spirit will teach you at that
time what you should say.”</p>
<hr/>

<h3><strong>Luke 12:13–21</strong></h3>
<p><strong>The Parable of the Rich Fool</strong></p>
<p>13 Someone in the crowd said to him, “Teacher, tell my brother
to divide the inheritance with me.”</p>
<p>14 Jesus replied, “Man, who appointed me a judge or an arbiter
between you?”<br/>
15 Then he said to them, “Watch out! Be on
your guard against all kinds of greed; life does not consist in an
abundance of possessions.”</p>
<p>16 And he told them this parable: “The ground of a certain rich
man yielded an abundant harvest.<br/>
17 He thought to himself, ‘What
shall I do? I have no place to store my crops.’</p>
<p>18 “Then he said, ‘This is what I’ll do. I will tear down my
barns and build bigger ones, and there I will store my surplus
grain.<br/>
19 And I’ll say to myself, “You have plenty of grain
laid up for many years. Take life easy; eat, drink and be merry.”’</p>
<p>20 “But God said to him, ‘You fool! This very night your life
will be demanded from you. Then who will get what you have prepared
for yourself?’</p>
<p>21 “This is how it will be with whoever stores up things for
themselves but is not rich toward God.”</p>
<hr/>

<h3><strong>Luke 12:22–34</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Do Not Worry</strong></p>
<p>22 Then Jesus said to his disciples: “Therefore I tell you, do
not worry about your life, what you will eat; or about your body,
what you will wear.<br/>
23 For life is more than food, and the body
more than clothes.<br/>
24 Consider the ravens: They do not sow or
reap, they have no storeroom or barn; yet God feeds them. And how
much more valuable you are than birds!<br/>
25 Who of you by worrying
can add a single hour to your life?<br/>
26 Since you cannot do this
very little thing, why do you worry about the rest?</p>
<p>27 “Consider how the wild flowers grow. They do not labor or
spin. Yet I tell you, not even Solomon in all his splendor was
dressed like one of these.<br/>
28 If that is how God clothes the
grass of the field, which is here today, and tomorrow is thrown into
the fire, how much more will he clothe you—you of little faith!<br/>
29
And do not set your heart on what you will eat or drink; do not worry
about it.<br/>
30 For the pagan world runs after all such things, and
your Father knows that you need them.<br/>
31 But seek his kingdom,
and these things will be given to you as well.</p>
<p>32 “Do not be afraid, little flock, for your Father has been
pleased to give you the kingdom.<br/>
33 Sell your possessions and
give to the poor. Provide purses for yourselves that will not wear
out, a treasure in heaven that will never fail, where no thief comes
near and no moth destroys.<br/>
34 For where your treasure is, there
your heart will be also.</p>

<h3><strong>Luke 12:35–48</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Watchfulness</strong></p>
<p>35 “Be dressed ready for service and keep your lamps burning,<br/>
36
like servants waiting for their master to return from a wedding
banquet, so that when he comes and knocks they can immediately open
the door for him.<br/>
37 It will be good for those servants whose
master finds them watching when he comes. Truly I tell you, he will
dress himself to serve, will have them recline at the table and will
come and wait on them.<br/>
38 It will be good for those servants
whose master finds them ready, even if he comes in the middle of the
night or toward daybreak.<br/>
39 But understand this: If the owner
of the house had known at what hour the thief was coming, he would
not have let his house be broken into.<br/>
40 You also must be
ready, because the Son of Man will come at an hour when you do not
expect him.”</p>
<p>41 Peter asked, “Lord, are you telling this parable to us, or to
everyone?”</p>
<p>42 The Lord answered, “Who then is the faithful and wise
manager, whom the master puts in charge of his servants to give them
their food allowance at the proper time?<br/>
43 It will be good for
that servant whom the master finds doing so when he returns.<br/>
44
Truly I tell you, he will put him in charge of all his
possessions.<br/>
45 But suppose the servant says to himself, ‘My
master is taking a long time in coming,’ and he then begins to beat
the other servants, both men and women, and to eat and drink and get
drunk.<br/>
46 The master of that servant will come on a day when he
does not expect him and at an hour he is not aware of. He will cut
him to pieces and assign him a place with the unbelievers.</p>
<p>47 “The servant who knows the master’s will and does not get
ready or does not do what the master wants will be beaten with many
blows.<br/>
48 But the one who does not know and does things
deserving punishment will be beaten with few blows. From everyone who
has been given much, much will be demanded; and from the one who has
been entrusted with much, much more will be asked.</p>

<h3><strong>Luke 12:49–53</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Not Peace but Division</strong></p>

50 But I have a baptism to undergo, and
what constraint I am under until it is completed!<br/>
51 Do you
think I came to bring peace on earth? No, I tell you, but

<h3><strong>Luke 12:54–59</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Interpreting the Times</strong></p>
<p>54 He said to the crowd: “When you see a cloud rising in the
west, immediately you say, ‘It’s going to rain,’ and it
does.<br/>
55 And when the south wind blows, you say, ‘It’s going
to be hot,’ and it is.<br/>
56 Hypocrites! You know how to

<p>57 “Why don’t you judge for yourselves what is right?<br/>

As you are going with your adversary to the magistrate, try hard to
be reconciled on the way, or your adversary may drag you off to the
judge, and the judge turn you over to the officer, and the officer

<h3><strong>Luke 13:1–9</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Repent or Perish</strong></p>
<p>1 Now there were some present at that time who told Jesus about
the Galileans whose blood Pilate had mixed with their sacrifices.<br/>
2
Jesus answered, “Do you think that these Galileans were worse
sinners than all the other Galileans because they suffered this
way?<br/>
3 I tell you, no! But unless you repent, you too will all
perish.<br/>
4 Or those eighteen who died when the tower in Siloam
fell on them—do you think they were more guilty than all the others
living in Jerusalem?<br/>
5 I tell you, no! But unless you repent,
you too will all perish.”</p>
<p><strong>The Parable of the Fig Tree</strong></p>
<p>6 Then he told this parable: “A man had a fig tree growing in
his vineyard, and he went to look for fruit on it but did not find
any.<br/>
7 So he said to the man who took care of the vineyard, ‘For
three years now I’ve been coming to look for fruit on this fig tree
and haven’t found any. Cut it down! Why should it use up the soil?’</p>
<p>8 “‘Sir,’ the man replied, ‘leave it alone for one more

fruit next year, fine! If not, then cut it down.’”</p>

<h3><strong>Luke 13:10–17</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Jesus Heals a Crippled Woman on the Sabbath</strong></p>
<p>10 On a Sabbath Jesus was teaching in one of the synagogues,<br/>
11
and a woman was there who had been crippled by a spirit for eighteen
years. She was bent over and could not straighten up at all.<br/>
12
When Jesus saw her, he called her forward and said to her, “Woman,
you are set free from your infirmity.”<br/>
13 Then he put his
hands on her, and immediately she straightened up and praised God.</p>
<p>14 Indignant because Jesus had healed on the Sabbath, the
synagogue leader said to the people, “There are six days for work.
So come and be healed on those days, not on the Sabbath.”</p>
<p>15 The Lord answered him, “You hypocrites! Doesn’t each of you
on the Sabbath untie your ox or donkey from the stall and lead it out
to give it water?<br/>
16 Then should not this woman, a daughter of
Abraham, whom Satan has kept bound for eighteen long years, be set
free on the Sabbath day from what bound her?”</p>
<p>17 When he said this, all his opponents were humiliated, but the
people were delighted with all the wonderful things he was doing.</p>
<hr/>

<h3><strong>Luke 13:18–21</strong></h3>
<p><strong>The Parables of the Mustard Seed and the Yeast</strong></p>
<p>18 Then Jesus asked, “What is the kingdom of God like? What
shall I compare it to?<br/>
19 It is like a mustard seed, which a man
took and planted in his garden. It grew and became a tree, and the
birds perched in its branches.”</p>
<p>20 Again he asked, “What shall I compare the kingdom of God
to?<br/>
21 It is like yeast that a woman took and mixed into about
sixty pounds of flour until it worked all through the dough.”</p>

<h3><strong>Luke 13:22–30</strong></h3>
<p><strong>The Narrow Door</strong></p>
<p>22 Then Jesus went through the towns and villages, teaching as he
made his way to Jerusalem.<br/>
23 Someone asked him, “Lord, are
only a few people going to be saved?”</p>
<p>He said to them,<br/>
24 “Make every effort to enter through the
narrow door, because many, I tell you, will try to enter and will not
be able to.<br/>
25 Once the owner of the house gets up and closes
the door, you will stand outside knocking and pleading, ‘Sir, open
the door for us.’</p>
<p>“But he will answer, ‘I don’t know you or where you come
from.’</p>
<p>26 “Then you will say, ‘We ate and drank with you, and you
taught in our streets.’</p>
<p>27 “But he will reply, ‘I don’t know you or where you come
from. Away from me, all you evildoers!’</p>
<p>28 “There will be weeping there, and gnashing of teeth, when you
see Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob and all the prophets in the kingdom of
God, but you yourselves thrown out.<br/>
29 People will come from
east and west and north and south, and will take their places at the
feast in the kingdom of God.<br/>
30 Indeed there are those who are
last who will be first, and first who will be last.”</p>
<hr/>

<h3><strong>Luke 13:31–35</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Jesus’ Sorrow for Jerusalem</strong></p>
<p>31 At that time some Pharisees came to Jesus and said to him,
“Leave this place and go somewhere else. Herod wants to kill you.”</p>
<p>32 He replied, “Go tell that fox, ‘I will keep on driving out
demons and healing people today and tomorrow, and on the third day I
will reach my goal.’<br/>
33 In any case, I must press on today and

<p>34 “Jerusalem, Jerusalem, you who kill the prophets and stone
those sent to you, how often I have longed to gather your children

<h3><strong>Luke 14:1–14</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Jesus at a Pharisee’s House</strong></p>
<p>1 One Sabbath, when Jesus went to eat in the house of a prominent
Pharisee, he was being carefully watched.<br/>
2 There in front of
him was a man suffering from abnormal swelling of his body.<br/>
3
Jesus asked the Pharisees and experts in the law, “Is it lawful to
heal on the Sabbath or not?”<br/>
4 But they remained silent. So
taking hold of the man, he healed him and sent him on his way.</p>
<p>5 Then he asked them, “If one of you has a child or an ox that
falls into a well on the Sabbath day, will you not immediately pull
it out?”<br/>
6 And they had nothing to say.</p>
<p><strong>Humility and Honor</strong></p>
<p>7 When he noticed how the guests picked the places of honor at the
table, he told them this parable:<br/>
8 “When someone invites you
to a wedding feast, do not take the place of honor, for a person more
distinguished than you may have been invited.<br/>
9 If so, the host
who invited both of you will come and say to you, ‘Give this person
your seat.’ Then, humiliated, you will have to take the least
important place.<br/>
10 But when you are invited, take the lowest
place, so that when your host comes, he will say to you, ‘Friend,
move up to a better place.’ Then you will be honored in the
presence of all the other guests.<br/>
11 For all those who exalt
themselves will be humbled, and those who humble themselves will be
exalted.”</p>
<p>12 Then Jesus said to his host, “When you give a luncheon or
dinner, do not invite your friends, your brothers or sisters, your
relatives, or your rich neighbors; if you do, they may invite you
back, and so you will be repaid.<br/>
13 But when you give a banquet,
invite the poor, the crippled, the lame, the blind,<br/>
14 and you
will be blessed. Although they cannot repay you, you will be repaid
at the resurrection of the righteous.”</p>
<hr/>

<h3><strong>Luke 14:15–24</strong></h3>
<p><strong>The Parable of the Great Banquet</strong></p>
<p>15 When one of those at the table with him heard this, he said to
Jesus, “Blessed is the one who will eat at the feast in the kingdom
of God.”</p>
<p>16 Jesus replied: “A certain man was preparing a great banquet
and invited many guests.<br/>
17 At the time of the banquet he sent
his servant to tell those who had been invited, ‘Come, for
everything is now ready.’</p>
<p>18 “But they all alike began to make excuses. The first said, ‘I
have just bought a field, and I must go and see it. Please excuse
me.’<br/>
19 “Another said, ‘I have just bought five yoke of
oxen, and I’m on my way to try them out. Please excuse me.’<br/>
20
“Still another said, ‘I just got married, so I can’t come.’</p>
<p>21 “The servant came back and reported this to his master. Then
the owner of the house became angry and ordered his servant, ‘Go
out quickly into the streets and alleys of the town and bring in the
poor, the crippled, the blind and the lame.’</p>
<p>22 “‘Sir,’ the servant said, ‘what you ordered has been
done, but there is still room.’</p>
<p>23 “Then the master told his servant, ‘Go out to the roads and
country lanes and compel them to come in, so that my house will be
full.<br/>
24 I tell you, not one of those who were invited will get
a taste of my banquet.’”</p>
<hr/>

<h3><strong>Luke 14:25–35</strong></h3>
<p><strong>The Cost of Being a Disciple</strong></p>
<p>25 Large crowds were traveling with Jesus, and turning to them he
said:<br/>
26 “If anyone comes to me and does not hate father and
mother, wife and children, brothers and sisters—yes, even their own
life—such a person cannot be my disciple.<br/>
27 And whoever does
not carry their cross and follow me cannot be my disciple.</p>
<p>28 “Suppose one of you wants to build a tower. Won’t you first
sit down and estimate the cost to see if you have enough money to
complete it?<br/>
29 For if you lay the foundation and are not able
to finish it, everyone who sees it will ridicule you,<br/>
30 saying,
‘This person began to build and wasn’t able to finish.’</p>
<p>31 “Or suppose a king is about to go to war against another
king. Won’t he first sit down and consider whether he is able with
ten thousand men to oppose the one coming against him with twenty
thousand?<br/>
32 If he is not able, he will send a delegation while
the other is still a long way off and will ask for terms of peace.<br/>
33
In the same way, those of you who do not give up everything you have
cannot be my disciples.</p>
<p>34 “Salt is good, but if it loses its saltiness, how can it be
made salty again?<br/>
35 It is fit neither for the soil nor for the
manure pile; it is thrown out.</p>
<p>“Whoever has ears to hear, let them hear.”</p>
<hr/>

<h3><strong>Luke 15:1–7</strong></h3>
<p><strong>The Parable of the Lost Sheep</strong></p>
<p>1 Now the tax collectors and sinners were all gathering around to
hear Jesus.<br/>
2 But the Pharisees and the teachers of the law
muttered, “This man welcomes sinners and eats with them.”</p>
<p>3 Then Jesus told them this parable:<br/>
4 “Suppose one of you
has a hundred sheep and loses one of them. Doesn’t he leave the
ninety-nine in the open country and go after the lost sheep until he
finds it?<br/>
5 And when he finds it, he joyfully puts it on his
shoulders<br/>
6 and goes home. Then he calls his friends and
neighbors together and says, ‘Rejoice with me; I have found my lost
sheep.’</p>
<p>7 I tell you that in the same way there will be more rejoicing in
heaven over one sinner who repents than over ninety-nine righteous
persons who do not need to repent.</p>
<hr/>

<h3><strong>Luke 15:8–10</strong></h3>
<p><strong>The Parable of the Lost Coin</strong></p>
<p>8 “Or suppose a woman has ten silver coins and loses one.
Doesn’t she light a lamp, sweep the house, and search carefully
until she finds it?<br/>
9 And when she finds it, she calls her
friends and neighbors together and says, ‘Rejoice with me; I have
found my lost coin.’</p>
<p>10 In the same way, I tell you, there is rejoicing in the presence
of the angels of God over one sinner who repents.”</p>
<hr/>

<h3><strong>Luke 15:11–32</strong></h3>
<p><strong>The Parable of the Prodigal Son</strong></p>
<p>11 Jesus continued: “There was a man who had two sons.<br/>
12
The younger one said to his father, ‘Father, give me my share of
the estate.’ So he divided his property between them.</p>
<p>13 “Not long after that, the younger son got together all he
had, set off for a distant country and there squandered his wealth in
wild living.<br/>
14 After he had spent everything, there was a
severe famine in that whole country, and he began to be in need.<br/>
15
So he went and hired himself out to a citizen of that country, who
sent him to his fields to feed pigs.<br/>
16 He longed to fill his
stomach with the pods that the pigs were eating, but no one gave him
anything.</p>
<p>17 “When he came to his senses, he said, ‘How many of my
father’s hired servants have food to spare, and here I am starving
to death!<br/>
18 I will set out and go back to my father and say to
him: Father, I have sinned against heaven and against you.<br/>
19 I
am no longer worthy to be called your son; make me like one of your
hired servants.’<br/>
20 So he got up and went to his father.</p>
<p>“But while he was still a long way off, his father saw him and
was filled with compassion for him; he ran to his son, threw his arms
around him and kissed him.</p>
<p>21 “The son said to him, ‘Father, I have sinned against heaven
and against you. I am no longer worthy to be called your son.’</p>
<p>22 “But the father said to his servants, ‘Quick! Bring the
best robe and put it on him. Put a ring on his finger and sandals on
his feet.<br/>
23 Bring the fattened calf and kill it. Let’s have a
feast and celebrate.<br/>
24 For this son of mine was dead and is
alive again; he was lost and is found.’ So they began to celebrate.</p>
<p>25 “Meanwhile, the older son was in the field. When he came near
the house, he heard music and dancing.<br/>
26 So he called one of
the servants and asked him what was going on.<br/>
27 ‘Your brother
has come,’ he replied, ‘and your father has killed the fattened
calf because he has him back safe and sound.’</p>
<p>28 “The older brother became angry and refused to go in. So his
father went out and pleaded with him.<br/>
29 But he answered his
father, ‘Look! All these years I’ve been slaving for you and
never disobeyed your orders. Yet you never gave me even a young goat
so I could celebrate with my friends.<br/>
30 But when this son of
yours who has squandered your property with prostitutes comes home,
you kill the fattened calf for him!’</p>
<p>31 “‘My son,’ the father said, ‘you are always with me,
and everything I have is yours.<br/>
32 But we had to celebrate and
be glad, because this brother of yours was dead and is alive again;
he was lost and is found.’”</p>
<hr/>

<p>This concludes <strong>Luke 15</strong>. Would you like me to

<h3><strong>Luke 16:1–15</strong></h3>
<p><strong>The Parable of the Shrewd Manager</strong></p>
<p>1 Jesus told his disciples: “There was a rich man whose manager
was accused of wasting his possessions.<br/>
2 So he called him in
and asked him, ‘What is this I hear about you? Give an account of
your management, because you cannot be manager any longer.’</p>
<p>3 “The manager said to himself, ‘What shall I do now? My
master is taking away my job. I’m not strong enough to dig, and I’m
ashamed to beg—<br/>
4 I know what I’ll do so that, when I lose
my job here, people will welcome me into their houses.’</p>
<p>5 “So he called in each one of his master’s debtors. He asked
the first, ‘How much do you owe my master?’</p>
<p>6 “‘Nine hundred gallons of olive oil,’ he replied.</p>
<p>“The manager told him, ‘Take your bill, sit down quickly, and
make it four hundred and fifty.’</p>
<p>7 “Then he asked the second, ‘And how much do you owe?’</p>
<p>“‘A thousand bushels of wheat,’ he replied.</p>
<p>“He told him, ‘Take your bill and make it eight hundred.’</p>
<p>8 “The master commended the dishonest manager because he had
acted shrewdly. For the people of this world are more shrewd in
dealing with their own kind than are the people of the light.<br/>
9
I tell you, use worldly wealth to gain friends for yourselves, so
that when it is gone, you will be welcomed into eternal dwellings.</p>
<p>10 “Whoever can be trusted with very little can also be trusted
with much, and whoever is dishonest with very little will also be
dishonest with much.<br/>
11 So if you have not been trustworthy in
handling worldly wealth, who will trust you with true riches?<br/>
12
And if you have not been trustworthy with someone else’s property,
who will give you property of your own?</p>
<p>13 “No one can serve two masters. Either you will hate the one
and love the other, or you will be devoted to the one and despise the
other. You cannot serve both God and money.”</p>
<p>14 The Pharisees, who loved money, heard all this and were
sneering at Jesus.<br/>
15 He said to them, “You are the ones who
justify yourselves in the eyes of others, but God knows your hearts.
What people value highly is detestable in God’s sight.”</p>
<hr/>

<h3><strong>Luke 16:16–18</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Additional Teachings</strong></p>
<p>16 “The Law and the Prophets were proclaimed until John. Since
that time, the good news of the kingdom of God is being preached, and
everyone is forcing their way into it.<br/>
17 It is easier for
heaven and earth to disappear than for the least stroke of a pen to
drop out of the Law.</p>
<p>18 “Anyone who divorces his wife and marries another woman
commits adultery, and the man who marries a divorced woman commits
adultery.”</p>
<hr/>

<h3><strong>Luke 16:19–31</strong></h3>
<p><strong>The Rich Man and Lazarus</strong></p>
<p>19 “There was a rich man who was dressed in purple and fine
linen and lived in luxury every day.<br/>
20 At his gate was laid a
beggar named Lazarus, covered with sores<br/>
21 and longing to eat
what fell from the rich man’s table. Even the dogs came and licked
his sores.</p>
<p>22 “The time came when the beggar died and the angels carried
him to Abraham’s side. The rich man also died and was buried.<br/>
23
In Hades, where he was in torment, he looked up and saw Abraham far
away, with Lazarus by his side.<br/>
24 So he called to him, ‘Father
Abraham, have pity on me and send Lazarus to dip the tip of his
finger in water and cool my tongue, because I am in agony in this
fire.’</p>
<p>25 “But Abraham replied, ‘Son, remember that in your lifetime
you received your good things, while Lazarus received bad things, but
now he is comforted here and you are in agony.<br/>
26 And besides
all this, between us and you a great chasm has been set in place, so
that those who want to go from here to you cannot, nor can anyone
cross over from there to us.’</p>
<p>27 “He answered, ‘Then I beg you, father, send Lazarus to my
family,<br/>
28 for I have five brothers. Let him warn them, so that
they will not also come to this place of torment.’</p>
<p>29 “Abraham replied, ‘They have Moses and the Prophets; let
them listen to them.’</p>
<p>30 “‘No, father Abraham,’ he said, ‘but if someone from
the dead goes to them, they will repent.’</p>
<p>31 “He said to him, ‘If they do not listen to Moses and the
Prophets, they will not be convinced even if someone rises from the
dead.’”</p>

<h3><strong>Luke 17:1–10</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Sin, Faith, and Duty</strong></p>
<p>1 Jesus said to his disciples: “Things that cause people to
stumble are bound to come, but woe to anyone through whom they
come.<br/>
2 It would be better for them to be thrown into the sea
with a millstone tied around their neck than to cause one of these
little ones to stumble.<br/>
3 So watch yourselves.</p>
<p>“If your brother or sister sins against you, rebuke them; and if
they repent, forgive them.<br/>
4 Even if they sin against you seven
times in a day and seven times come back to you saying ‘I repent,’
you must forgive them.”</p>
<p>5 The apostles said to the Lord, “Increase our faith!”</p>
<p>6 He replied, “If you have faith as small as a mustard seed, you
can say to this mulberry tree, ‘Be uprooted and planted in the
sea,’ and it will obey you.</p>
<p>7 “Suppose one of you has a servant plowing or looking after the
sheep. Will he say to the servant when he comes in from the field,
‘Come along now and sit down to eat’?<br/>
8 Won’t he rather
say, ‘Prepare my supper, get yourself ready and wait on me while I
eat and drink; after that you may eat and drink’?<br/>
9 Will he
thank the servant because he did what he was told to do?<br/>
10 So
you also, when you have done everything you were told to do, should
say, ‘We are unworthy servants; we have only done our duty.’”</p>
<hr/>

<h3><strong>Luke 17:11–19</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Jesus Heals Ten Men with Leprosy</strong></p>
<p>11 Now on his way to Jerusalem, Jesus traveled along the border
between Samaria and Galilee.<br/>
12 As he was going into a village,
ten men who had leprosy met him. They stood at a distance<br/>
13 and
called out in a loud voice, “Jesus, Master, have pity on us!”</p>
<p>14 When he saw them, he said, “Go, show yourselves to the
priests.” And as they went, they were cleansed.</p>
<p>15 One of them, when he saw he was healed, came back, praising God
in a loud voice.<br/>
16 He threw himself at Jesus’ feet and
thanked him—and he was a Samaritan.</p>
<p>17 Jesus asked, “Were not all ten cleansed? Where are the other
nine?<br/>
18 Has no one returned to give praise to God except this
foreigner?”<br/>
19 Then he said to him, “Rise and go; your faith
has made you well.”</p>
<hr/>

<h3><strong>Luke 17:20–37</strong></h3>
<p><strong>The Coming of the Kingdom of God</strong></p>
<p>20 Once, on being asked by the Pharisees when the kingdom of God
would come, Jesus replied, “The coming of the kingdom of God is not
something that can be observed,<br/>
21 nor will people say, ‘Here
it is,’ or ‘There it is,’ because the kingdom of God is in your
midst.”</p>
<p>22 Then he said to his disciples, “The time is coming when you
will long to see one of the days of the Son of Man, but you will not
see it.<br/>
23 People will tell you, ‘There he is!’ or ‘Here
he is!’ Do not go running off after them.<br/>
24 For the Son of
Man in his day will be like the lightning, which flashes and lights
up the sky from one end to the other.<br/>
25 But first he must
suffer many things and be rejected by this generation.</p>
<p>26 “Just as it was in the days of Noah, so also will it be in
the days of the Son of Man.<br/>
27 People were eating, drinking,
marrying and being given in marriage up to the day Noah entered the
ark. Then the flood came and destroyed them all.</p>
<p>28 “It was the same in the days of Lot. People were eating and
drinking, buying and selling, planting and building.<br/>
29 But the
day Lot left Sodom, fire and sulfur rained down from heaven and
destroyed them all.</p>
<p>30 “It will be just like this on the day the Son of Man is
revealed.<br/>
31 On that day no one who is on the housetop, with
possessions inside, should go down to get them. Likewise, no one in
the field should go back for anything.<br/>
32 Remember Lot’s
wife!<br/>
33 Whoever tries to keep their life will lose it, and
whoever loses their life will preserve it.<br/>
34 I tell you, on
that night two people will be in one bed; one will be taken and the
other left.<br/>
35 Two women will be grinding grain together; one
will be taken and the other left.”</p>
<p>37 “Where, Lord?” they asked.</p>
<p>He replied, “Where there is a dead body, there the vultures will
gather.”</p>
<hr/>

<h3><strong>Luke 18:1–8</strong></h3>
<p><strong>The Parable of the Persistent Widow</strong></p>
<p>1 Then Jesus told his disciples a parable to show them that they
should always pray and not give up.<br/>
2 He said: “In a certain
town there was a judge who neither feared God nor cared what people
thought.<br/>
3 And there was a widow in that town who kept coming to
him with the plea, ‘Grant me justice against my adversary.’</p>
<p>4 “For some time he refused. But finally he said to himself,
‘Even though I don’t fear God or care what people think,<br/>
5
yet because this widow keeps bothering me, I will see that she gets
justice, so that she won’t eventually come and attack me!’”</p>
<p>6 And the Lord said, “Listen to what the unjust judge says.<br/>
7
And will not God bring about justice for his chosen ones, who cry out
to him day and night? Will he keep putting them off?<br/>
8 I tell
you, he will see that they get justice, and quickly. However, when
the Son of Man comes, will he find faith on the earth?”</p>
<hr/>

<h3><strong>Luke 18:9–14</strong></h3>
<p><strong>The Parable of the Pharisee and the Tax Collector</strong></p>
<p>9 To some who were confident of their own righteousness and looked
down on everyone else, Jesus told this parable:<br/>
10 “Two men
went up to the temple to pray, one a Pharisee and the other a tax
collector.<br/>
11 The Pharisee stood by himself and prayed: ‘God,
I thank you that I am not like other people—robbers, evildoers,
adulterers—or even like this tax collector.<br/>
12 I fast twice a
week and give a tenth of all I get.’</p>
<p>13 “But the tax collector stood at a distance. He would not even
look up to heaven, but beat his breast and said, ‘God, have mercy
on me, a sinner.’</p>
<p>14 “I tell you that this man, rather than the other, went home
justified before God. For all those who exalt themselves will be
humbled, and those who humble themselves will be exalted.”</p>
<hr/>

<h3><strong>Luke 18:15–17</strong></h3>
<p><strong>The Little Children and Jesus</strong></p>
<p>15 People were also bringing babies to Jesus for him to place his
hands on them. When the disciples saw this, they rebuked them.<br/>
16
But Jesus called the children to him and said, “Let the little
children come to me, and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of God
belongs to such as these.<br/>
17 Truly I tell you, anyone who will
not receive the kingdom of God like a little child will never enter
it.”</p>
<hr/>

<h3><strong>Luke 18:18–30</strong></h3>
<p><strong>The Rich and the Kingdom of God</strong></p>
<p>18 A certain ruler asked him, “Good teacher, what must I do to
inherit eternal life?”</p>
<p>19 “Why do you call me good?” Jesus answered. “No one is
good—except God alone.<br/>
20 You know the commandments: ‘You
shall not commit adultery, you shall not murder, you shall not steal,
you shall not give false testimony, honor your father and mother.’”</p>
<p>21 “All these I have kept since I was a boy,” he said.</p>
<p>22 When Jesus heard this, he said to him, “You still lack one
thing. Sell everything you have and give to the poor, and you will
have treasure in heaven. Then come, follow me.”</p>
<p>23 When he heard this, he became very sad, because he was very
wealthy.</p>
<p>24 Jesus looked at him and said, “How hard it is for the rich to
enter the kingdom of God!<br/>
25 Indeed, it is easier for a camel to
go through the eye of a needle than for someone who is rich to enter
the kingdom of God.”</p>
<p>26 Those who heard this asked, “Who then can be saved?”</p>
<p>27 Jesus replied, “What is impossible with man is possible with
God.”</p>
<p>28 Peter said to him, “We have left all we had to follow you!”</p>
<p>29 “Truly I tell you,” Jesus said to them, “no one who has
left home or wife or brothers or sisters or parents or children for
the sake of the kingdom of God<br/>
30 will fail to receive many
times as much in this age, and in the age to come eternal life.”</p>
<hr/>

<h3><strong>Luke 18:31–34</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Jesus Predicts His Death a Third Time</strong></p>
<p>31 Jesus took the Twelve aside and told them, “We are going up
to Jerusalem, and everything that is written by the prophets about
the Son of Man will be fulfilled.<br/>
32 He will be delivered over
to the Gentiles. They will mock him, insult him and spit on him;<br/>
33
they will flog him and kill him. On the third day he will rise
again.”</p>
<p>34 The disciples did not understand any of this. Its meaning was
hidden from them, and they did not know what he was talking about.</p>
<hr/>

<h3><strong>Luke 18:35–43</strong></h3>
<p><strong>A Blind Beggar Receives His Sight</strong></p>
<p>35 As Jesus approached Jericho, a blind man was sitting by the
roadside begging.<br/>
36 When he heard the crowd going by, he asked
what was happening.<br/>
37 They told him, “Jesus of Nazareth is
passing by.”</p>
<p>38 He called out, “Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!”</p>
<p>39 Those who led the way rebuked him and told him to be quiet, but
he shouted all the more, “Son of David, have mercy on me!”</p>
<p>40 Jesus stopped and ordered the man to be brought to him. When he
came near, Jesus asked him,<br/>
41 “What do you want me to do for
you?”</p>
<p>“Lord, I want to see,” he replied.</p>
<p>42 Jesus said to him, “Receive your sight; your faith has healed
you.”<br/>
43 Immediately he received his sight and followed Jesus,
praising God. When all the people saw it, they also praised God.</p>
<hr/>

2 A man was
there by the name of Zacchaeus; he was a chief tax collector and was
wealthy.<br/>
3 He wanted to see who Jesus was, but because he was
short he could not see over the crowd.<br/>
4 So he ran ahead and
climbed a sycamore-fig tree to see him, since Jesus was coming that
way.</p>
<p>5 When Jesus reached the spot, he looked up and said to him,
“Zacchaeus, come down immediately. I must stay at your house
today.”<br/>
6 So he came down at once and welcomed him gladly.</p>
<p>7 All the people saw this and began to mutter, “He has gone to
be the guest of a sinner.”</p>
<p>8 But Zacchaeus stood up and said to the Lord, “Look, Lord! Here
and now I give half of my possessions to the poor, and if I have
cheated anybody out of anything, I will pay back four times the
amount.”</p>
<p>9 Jesus said to him, “Today salvation has come to this house,
because this man, too, is a son of Abraham.<br/>
10 For the Son of
Man came to seek and to save the lost.”</p>

<h3><strong>Luke 19:11–27</strong></h3>
<p><strong>The Parable of the Ten Minas</strong></p>
<p>11 While they were listening to this, he went on to tell them a
parable, because he was near Jerusalem and the people thought that
the kingdom of God was going to appear at once.<br/>
12 He said: “A
man of noble birth went to a distant country to have himself
appointed king and then to return.<br/>
13 So he called ten of his
servants and gave them ten minas. ‘Put this money to work,’ he
said, ‘until I come back.’</p>
<p>14 “But his subjects hated him and sent a delegation after him
to say, ‘We don’t want this man to be our king.’</p>
<p>15 “He was made king, however, and returned home. Then he sent
for the servants to whom he had given the money, in order to find out
what they had gained with it.</p>
<p>16 “The first one came and said, ‘Sir, your mina has earned
ten more.’</p>
<p>17 “‘Well done, my good servant!’ his master replied.
‘Because you have been trustworthy in a very small matter, take
charge of ten cities.’</p>
<p>18 “The second came and said, ‘Sir, your mina has earned five
more.’</p>
<p>19 “His master answered, ‘You take charge of five cities.’</p>
<p>20 “Then another servant came and said, ‘Sir, here is your
mina; I have kept it laid away in a piece of cloth.<br/>
21 I was
afraid of you, because you are a hard man. You take out what you did
not put in and reap what you did not sow.’</p>
<p>22 “His master replied, ‘I will judge you by your own words,
you wicked servant! You knew, did you, that I am a hard man, taking
out what I did not put in and reaping what I did not sow?<br/>
23 Why
then didn’t you put my money on deposit, so that when I came back,
I could have collected it with interest?’</p>
<p>24 “Then he said to those standing by, ‘Take his mina away
from him and give it to the one who has ten minas.’</p>
<p>25 “‘Sir,’ they said, ‘he already has ten!’</p>
<p>26 “He replied, ‘I tell you that to everyone who has, more
will be given, but as for the one who has nothing, even what they
have will be taken away.<br/>
27 But those enemies of mine who did
not want me to be king over them—bring them here and kill them in
front of me.’”</p>
<hr/>

<h3><strong>Luke 19:28–40</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Jesus Comes to Jerusalem as King</strong></p>
<p>28 After Jesus had said this, he went on ahead, going up to
Jerusalem.<br/>
29 As he approached Bethphage and Bethany at the hill
called the Mount of Olives, he sent two of his disciples, saying to
them,<br/>
30 “Go to the village ahead of you, and as you enter it,
you will find a colt tied there, which no one has ever ridden. Untie
it and bring it here.<br/>
31 If anyone asks you, ‘Why are you
untying it?’ say, ‘The Lord needs it.’”</p>
<p>32 Those who were sent ahead went and found it just as he had told
them.<br/>
33 As they were untying the colt, its owners asked them,
“Why are you untying the colt?”</p>
<p>34 They replied, “The Lord needs it.”</p>
<p>35 They brought it to Jesus, threw their cloaks on the colt and
put Jesus on it.<br/>
36 As he went along, people spread their cloaks
on the road.</p>
<p>37 When he came near the place where the road goes down the Mount
of Olives, the whole crowd of disciples began joyfully to praise God
in loud voices for all the miracles they had seen:</p>
<p>38 “Blessed is the king who comes in the name of the
Lord!”<br/>
“Peace in heaven and glory in the highest!”</p>
<p>39 Some of the Pharisees in the crowd said to Jesus, “Teacher,
rebuke your disciples!”</p>
<p>40 “I tell you,” he replied, “if they keep quiet, the stones
will cry out.”</p>
<hr/>

<h3><strong>Luke 19:41–44</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Jesus Weeps Over Jerusalem</strong></p>
<p>41 As he approached Jerusalem and saw the city, he wept over it<br/>
42
and said, “If you, even you, had only known on this day what would
bring you peace—but now it is hidden from your eyes.<br/>
43 The
days will come upon you when your enemies will build an embankment
against you and encircle you and hem you in on every side.<br/>
44
They will dash you to the ground, you and the children within your
walls. They will not leave one stone on another, because you did not
recognize the time of God’s coming to you.”</p>
<hr/>

<h3><strong>Luke 19:45–48</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Jesus Cleanses the Temple</strong></p>
<p>45 When Jesus entered the temple courts, he began to drive out
those who were selling.<br/>
46 “It is written,” he said to them,
“‘My house will be a house of prayer’; but you have made it ‘a
den of robbers.’”</p>
<p>47 Every day he was teaching at the temple. But the chief priests,
the teachers of the law and the leaders among the people were trying
to kill him.<br/>
48 Yet they could not find any way to do it,
because all the people hung on his words.</p>
<hr/>

<p>This concludes <strong>Luke 19</strong>. Would you like me to
continue with <strong>Luke 20</strong>, which includes Jesus’
authority being questioned, the parable of the tenants, and
discussions about paying taxes to Caesar and the resurrection?</p>

<h3><strong>Luke 20:1–8</strong></h3>
<p><strong>The Authority of Jesus Questioned</strong></p>
<p>1 One day as Jesus was teaching the people in the temple courts
and proclaiming the good news, the chief priests and the teachers of
the law, together with the elders, came up to him.<br/>
2 “Tell us
by what authority you are doing these things,” they said. “Who
gave you this authority?”</p>
<p>3 He replied, “I will also ask you a question. Tell me:<br/>
4
John’s baptism—was it from heaven, or of human origin?”</p>
<p>5 They discussed it among themselves and said, “If we say, ‘From
heaven,’ he will ask, ‘Why didn’t you believe him?’<br/>
6
But if we say, ‘Of human origin,’ all the people will stone us,
because they are persuaded that John was a prophet.”</p>
<p>7 So they answered, “We don’t know where it was from.”</p>
<p>8 Jesus said, “Neither will I tell you by what authority I am
doing these things.”</p>
<hr/>

<h3><strong>Luke 20:9–19</strong></h3>
<p><strong>The Parable of the Tenants</strong></p>
<p>9 He went on to tell the people this parable: “A man planted a
vineyard, rented it to some farmers and went away for a long time.<br/>
10
At harvest time he sent a servant to the tenants so they would give
him some of the fruit of the vineyard. But the tenants beat him and
sent him away empty-handed.<br/>
11 He sent another servant, but that
one also they beat and treated shamefully and sent away
empty-handed.<br/>
12 He sent still a third, and they wounded him and
threw him out.</p>
<p>13 “Then the owner of the vineyard said, ‘What shall I do? I
will send my son, whom I love; perhaps they will respect him.’</p>
<p>14 “But when the tenants saw him, they talked the matter over.
‘This is the heir,’ they said. ‘Let’s kill him, and the
inheritance will be ours.’<br/>
15 So they threw him out of the
vineyard and killed him.</p>
<p>“What then will the owner of the vineyard do to them?<br/>
16 He
will come and kill those tenants and give the vineyard to others.”</p>
<p>When the people heard this, they said, “God forbid!”</p>
<p>17 Jesus looked directly at them and asked, “Then what is the
meaning of that which is written:<br/>
“‘The stone the builders
rejected<br/>
has become the cornerstone’?</p>
<p>18 Everyone who falls on that stone will be broken to pieces;
anyone on whom it falls will be crushed.”</p>
<p>19 The teachers of the law and the chief priests looked for a way
to arrest him immediately, because they knew he had spoken this
parable against them. But they were afraid of the people.</p>
<hr/>

<h3><strong>Luke 20:20–26</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Paying Taxes to Caesar</strong></p>
<p>20 Keeping a close watch on him, they sent spies, who pretended to
be sincere. They hoped to catch Jesus in something he said, so that
they might hand him over to the power and authority of the
governor.<br/>
21 So the spies questioned him: “Teacher, we know
that you speak and teach what is right, and that you do not show
partiality but teach the way of God in accordance with the truth.<br/>
22
Is it right for us to pay taxes to Caesar or not?”</p>
<p>23 He saw through their duplicity and said to them,<br/>
24 “Show
me a denarius. Whose image and inscription are on it?”</p>
<p>“Caesar’s,” they replied.</p>
<p>25 He said to them, “Then give back to Caesar what is Caesar’s,
and to God what is God’s.”</p>
<p>26 They were unable to trap him in what he had said there in
public. And astonished by his answer, they became silent.</p>
<hr/>

<h3><strong>Luke 20:27–40</strong></h3>
<p><strong>The Resurrection and Marriage</strong></p>
<p>27 Some of the Sadducees, who say there is no resurrection, came
to Jesus with a question.<br/>
28 “Teacher,” they said, “Moses
wrote for us that if a man’s brother dies and leaves a wife but no
children, the man must marry the widow and raise up offspring for his
brother.<br/>
29 Now there were seven brothers. The first one married
a woman and died childless.<br/>
30 The second<br/>
31 and then the
third married her, and in the same way the seven died, leaving no
children.<br/>
32 Finally, the woman died too.<br/>
33 Now then, at
the resurrection whose wife will she be, since the seven were married
to her?”</p>
<p>34 Jesus replied, “The people of this age marry and are given in
marriage.<br/>
35 But those who are considered worthy of taking part
in the age to come and in the resurrection from the dead will neither
marry nor be given in marriage,<br/>
36 and they can no longer die;
for they are like the angels. They are God’s children, since they
are children of the resurrection.</p>
<p>37 But in the account of the burning bush, even Moses showed that
the dead rise, for he calls the Lord ‘the God of Abraham, and the
God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.’<br/>
38 He is not the God of
the dead, but of the living, for to him all are alive.”</p>
<p>39 Some of the teachers of the law responded, “Well said,
teacher!”<br/>
40 And no one dared to ask him any more questions.</p>
<hr/>

<h3><strong>Luke 20:41–44</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Whose Son Is the Messiah?</strong></p>
<p>41 Then Jesus said to them, “Why is it said that the Messiah is
the son of David?<br/>
42 David himself declares in the Book of
Psalms:<br/>
“‘The Lord said to my Lord:<br/>
“Sit at my right
hand<br/>
43 until I make your enemies<br/>
a footstool for your
feet.”’</p>
<p>44 David calls him ‘Lord.’ How then can he be his son?”</p>
<hr/>

<h3><strong>Luke 20:45–47</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Warning Against the Teachers of the Law</strong></p>
<p>45 While all the people were listening, Jesus said to his
disciples,<br/>
46 “Beware of the teachers of the law. They like to
walk around in flowing robes and love to be greeted with respect in
the marketplaces and have the most important seats in the synagogues
and the places of honor at banquets.<br/>
47 They devour widows’
houses and for a show make lengthy prayers. These men will be
punished most severely.”</p>
<hr/>

<h3><strong>Luke 21:1–4</strong></h3>
<p><strong>The Widow’s Offering</strong></p>
<p>1 As Jesus looked up, he saw the rich putting their gifts into the
temple treasury.<br/>
2 He also saw a poor widow put in two very
small copper coins.<br/>
3 “Truly I tell you,” he said, “this
poor widow has put in more than all the others.<br/>
4 All these
people gave their gifts out of their wealth; but she out of her
poverty put in all she had to live on.”</p>
<hr/>

<h3><strong>Luke 21:5–6</strong></h3>
<p><strong>The Destruction of the Temple Foretold</strong></p>
<p>5 Some of his disciples were remarking about how the temple was
adorned with beautiful stones and with gifts dedicated to God. But
Jesus said,<br/>
6 “As for what you see here, the time will come
when not one stone will be left on another; every one of them will be
thrown down.”</p>
<hr/>

<h3><strong>Luke 21:7–19</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Signs of the End Times</strong></p>
<p>7 “Teacher,” they asked, “when will these things happen? And
what will be the sign that they are about to take place?”</p>
<p>8 He replied: “Watch out that you are not deceived. For many
will come in my name, claiming, ‘I am he,’ and, ‘The time is
near.’ Do not follow them.<br/>
9 When you hear of wars and
uprisings, do not be frightened. These things must happen first, but
the end will not come right away.”</p>
<p>10 Then he said to them: “Nation will rise against nation, and
kingdom against kingdom.<br/>
11 There will be great earthquakes,
famines and pestilences in various places, and fearful events and
great signs from heaven.</p>
<p>12 “But before all this, they will seize you and persecute you.
They will hand you over to synagogues and put you in prison, and you
will be brought before kings and governors, and all on account of my
name.<br/>
13 And so you will bear testimony to me.<br/>
14 But make
up your mind not to worry beforehand how you will defend
yourselves.<br/>
15 For I will give you words and wisdom that none of
your adversaries will be able to resist or contradict.<br/>
16 You
will be betrayed even by parents, brothers and sisters, relatives and
friends, and they will put some of you to death.<br/>
17 Everyone
will hate you because of me.<br/>
18 But not a hair of your head will
perish.<br/>
19 Stand firm, and you will win life.”</p>
<hr/>

<h3><strong>Luke 21:20–24</strong></h3>
<p><strong>The Destruction of Jerusalem</strong></p>
<p>20 “When you see Jerusalem being surrounded by armies, you will
know that its desolation is near.<br/>
21 Then let those who are in
Judea flee to the mountains, let those in the city get out, and let
those in the country not enter the city.<br/>
22 For this is the time
of punishment in fulfillment of all that has been written.<br/>
23
How dreadful it will be in those days for pregnant women and nursing
mothers! There will be great distress in the land and wrath against
this people.<br/>
24 They will fall by the sword and will be taken as
prisoners to all the nations. Jerusalem will be trampled on by the
Gentiles until the times of the Gentiles are fulfilled.”</p>
<hr/>

<h3><strong>Luke 21:25–28</strong></h3>
<p><strong>The Coming of the Son of Man</strong></p>
<p>25 “There will be signs in the sun, moon and stars. On the
earth, nations will be in anguish and perplexity at the roaring and
tossing of the sea.<br/>
26 People will faint from terror,
apprehensive of what is coming on the world, for the heavenly bodies
will be shaken.<br/>
27 At that time they will see the Son of Man
coming in a cloud with power and great glory.<br/>
28 When these
things begin to take place, stand up and lift up your heads, because
your redemption is drawing near.”</p>

30 When they sprout leaves, you can see for yourselves

31 Even so, when you see these
things happening, you know that the kingdom of God is near.</p>

<h3><strong>Luke 22:1–6</strong></h3>
<p><strong>The Plot Against Jesus</strong></p>
<p>1 Now the Festival of Unleavened Bread, called the Passover, was
approaching,<br/>
2 and the chief priests and the teachers of the law
were looking for some way to get rid of Jesus, for they were afraid
of the people.<br/>
3 Then Satan entered Judas, called Iscariot, one
of the Twelve.<br/>
4 And Judas went to the chief priests and the
officers of the temple guard and discussed with them how he might
betray Jesus.<br/>
5 They were delighted and agreed to give him
money.<br/>
6 He consented, and watched for an opportunity to hand
Jesus over to them when no crowd was present.</p>
<hr/>

<h3><strong>Luke 22:7–13</strong></h3>
<p><strong>The Last Supper Preparations</strong></p>
<p>7 Then came the day of Unleavened Bread on which the Passover lamb
had to be sacrificed.<br/>
8 Jesus sent Peter and John, saying, “Go
and make preparations for us to eat the Passover.”</p>
<p>9 “Where do you want us to prepare for it?” they asked.</p>
<p>10 He replied, “As you enter the city, a man carrying a jar of
water will meet you. Follow him to the house that he enters,<br/>
11
and say to the owner of the house, ‘The Teacher asks: Where is the
guest room, where I may eat the Passover with my disciples?’<br/>
12
He will show you a large room upstairs, all furnished. Make
preparations there.”</p>
<p>13 They left and found things just as Jesus had told them. So they
prepared the Passover.</p>
<hr/>

<h3><strong>Luke 22:14–23</strong></h3>
<p><strong>The Last Supper</strong></p>
<p>14 When the hour came, Jesus and his apostles reclined at the
table.<br/>
15 And he said to them, “I have eagerly desired to eat
this Passover with you before I suffer.<br/>
16 For I tell you, I
will not eat it again until it finds fulfillment in the kingdom of
God.”</p>
<p>17 After taking the cup, he gave thanks and said, “Take this and
divide it among you.<br/>
18 For I tell you I will not drink again
from the fruit of the vine until the kingdom of God comes.”</p>
<p>19 And he took bread, gave thanks and broke it, and gave it to
them, saying, “This is my body given for you; do this in
remembrance of me.”</p>
<p>20 In the same way, after the supper he took the cup, saying,
“This cup is the new covenant in my blood, which is poured out for
you.<br/>
21 But the hand of him who is going to betray me is with
mine on the table.<br/>
22 The Son of Man will go as it has been
decreed. But woe to that man who betrays him!”<br/>
23 They began
to question among themselves which of them it might be who would do
this.</p>
<hr/>

<h3><strong>Luke 22:24–30</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Dispute Among the Disciples</strong></p>
<p>24 A dispute also arose among them as to which of them was
considered to be greatest.<br/>
25 Jesus said to them, “The kings
of the Gentiles lord it over them; and those who exercise authority
over them call themselves Benefactors.<br/>
26 But you are not to be
like that. Instead, the greatest among you should be like the
youngest, and the one who rules like the one who serves.<br/>
27 For
who is greater, the one who is at the table or the one who serves? Is
it not the one who is at the table? But I am among you as one who
serves.</p>
<p>28 You are those who have stood by me in my trials.<br/>
29 And I
confer on you a kingdom, just as my Father conferred one on me,<br/>
30
so that you may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom and sit on
thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.</p>

32 But I have prayed for you, Simon, that your faith may
not fail. And when you have turned back, strengthen your brothers.”</p>
<p>33 But he replied, “Lord, I am ready to go with you to prison

today, you will deny three times that you know me.”</p>
<hr/>

<h3><strong>Luke 22:35–38</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Jesus Prepares His Disciples</strong></p>
<p>35 Then Jesus asked them, “When I sent you without purse, bag or
sandals, did you lack anything?”</p>
<p>“Nothing,” they answered.</p>
<p>36 He said to them, “But now if you have a purse, take it, and
also a bag; and if you don’t have a sword, sell your cloak and buy
one.<br/>
37 It is written: ‘And he was numbered with the
transgressors’; and I tell you that this must be fulfilled in me.
Yes, what is written about me is reaching its fulfillment.”</p>
<p>38 The disciples said, “See, Lord, here are two swords.”</p>
<p>“That’s enough!” he replied.</p>
<hr/>

<h3><strong>Luke 22:39–46</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Jesus Prays on the Mount of Olives</strong></p>
<p>39 Jesus went out as usual to the Mount of Olives, and his
disciples followed him.<br/>
40 On reaching the place, he said to
them, “Pray that you will not fall into temptation.”</p>
<p>41 He withdrew about a stone’s throw beyond them, knelt down and
prayed,<br/>
42 “Father, if you are willing, take this cup from me;
yet not my will, but yours be done.”</p>
<p>43 An angel from heaven appeared to him and strengthened him.<br/>
44
And being in anguish, he prayed more earnestly, and his sweat was
like drops of blood falling to the ground.</p>
<p>45 When he rose from prayer and went back to the disciples, he
found them asleep, exhausted from sorrow.<br/>
46 “Why are you
sleeping?” he asked them. “Get up and pray so that you will not
fall into temptation.”</p>
<hr/>

<h3><strong>Luke 22:47–53</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Jesus Arrested</strong></p>
<p>47 While he was still speaking, a crowd came up, and the man who
was called Judas, one of the Twelve, was leading them. He approached
Jesus to kiss him,<br/>
48 but Jesus asked him, “Judas, are you
betraying the Son of Man with a kiss?”</p>
<p>49 When Jesus’ followers saw what was going to happen, they
said, “Lord, should we strike with our swords?”<br/>
50 And one
of them struck the servant of the high priest, cutting off his right
ear.</p>
<p>51 But Jesus answered, “No more of this!” And he touched the
man’s ear and healed him.</p>
<p>52 Then Jesus said to the chief priests, the officers of the
temple guard, and the elders, who had come for him, “Am I leading a
rebellion, that you have come with swords and clubs?<br/>
53 Every
day I was with you in the temple courts, and you did not lay a hand
on me. But this is your hour—when darkness reigns.”</p>

<p>Would you like me to continue with <strong>Luke 22</strong>,
including Peter’s denial and Jesus being mocked and brought before
the council?</p>

<h3><strong>Luke 22:54–62</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Peter Disowns Jesus</strong></p>
<p>54 Then seizing him, they led him away and took him into the house
of the high priest. Peter followed at a distance.<br/>
55 And when
some there had kindled a fire in the middle of the courtyard and had
sat down together, Peter sat down with them.</p>
<p>56 A servant girl saw him seated there in the firelight. She
looked closely at him and said, “This man was with him.”</p>
<p>57 But he denied it. “Woman, I don’t know him,” he said.</p>
<p>58 A little later someone else saw him and said, “You also are
one of them.”</p>
<p>“Man, I am not!” Peter replied.</p>
<p>59 About an hour later another asserted, “Certainly this fellow
was with him, for he is a Galilean.”</p>
<p>60 Peter replied, “Man, I don’t know what you’re talking
about!” Just as he was speaking, the rooster crowed.</p>
<p>61 The Lord turned and looked straight at Peter. Then Peter
remembered the word the Lord had spoken to him: “Before the rooster
crows today, you will disown me three times.”<br/>
62 And he went
outside and wept bitterly.</p>

<h3><strong>Luke 22:63–65</strong></h3>
<p><strong>The Guards Mock Jesus</strong></p>
<p>63 The men who were guarding Jesus began mocking and beating
him.<br/>
64 They blindfolded him and demanded, “Prophesy! Who hit
you?”<br/>
65 And they said many other insulting things to him.</p>
<hr/>

<h3><strong>Luke 22:66–71</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Jesus Before the Council</strong></p>
<p>66 At daybreak the council of the elders of the people, both the
chief priests and the teachers of the law, met together, and Jesus
was led before them.<br/>
67 “If you are the Messiah,” they said,
“tell us.”</p>
<p>Jesus answered, “If I tell you, you will not believe me,<br/>
68
and if I asked you, you would not answer.<br/>
69 But from now on,
the Son of Man will be seated at the right hand of the mighty God.”</p>
<p>70 They all asked, “Are you then the Son of God?”</p>
<p>He replied, “You say that I am.”</p>
<p>71 Then they said, “Why do we need any more testimony? We have
heard it from his own lips.”</p>

<h3><strong>Luke 23:1–5</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Jesus Before Pilate</strong></p>
<p>1 Then the whole assembly rose and led him off to Pilate.<br/>
2
And they began to accuse him, saying, “We have found this man
subverting our nation. He opposes payment of taxes to Caesar and
claims to be Messiah, a king.”</p>
<p>3 So Pilate asked Jesus, “Are you the king of the Jews?”</p>
<p>“You have said so,” Jesus replied.</p>
<p>4 Then Pilate announced to the chief priests and the crowd, “I
find no basis for a charge against this man.”</p>
<p>5 But they insisted, “He stirs up the people all over Judea by
his teaching. He started in Galilee and has come all the way here.”</p>
<hr/>

<h3><strong>Luke 23:6–12</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Jesus Before Herod</strong></p>
<p>6 On hearing this, Pilate asked if the man was a Galilean.<br/>
7
When he learned that Jesus was under Herod’s jurisdiction, he sent
him to Herod, who was also in Jerusalem at that time.</p>
<p>8 When Herod saw Jesus, he was greatly pleased, because for a long
time he had been wanting to see him. From what he had heard about
him, he hoped to see him perform a sign of some sort.<br/>
9 He plied
him with many questions, but Jesus gave him no answer.<br/>
10 The
chief priests and the teachers of the law were standing there,
vehemently accusing him.<br/>
11 Then Herod and his soldiers
ridiculed and mocked him. Dressing him in an elegant robe, they sent
him back to Pilate.<br/>
12 That day Herod and Pilate became
friends—before this they had been enemies.</p>
<hr/>

<h3><strong>Luke 23:13–25</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Pilate Hands Jesus Over to Be Crucified</strong></p>
<p>13 Pilate called together the chief priests, the rulers and the
people,<br/>
14 and said to them, “You brought me this man as one
who was inciting the people to rebellion. I have examined him in your
presence and have found no basis for your charges against him.<br/>
15
Neither has Herod, for he sent him back to us; as you can see, he has
done nothing to deserve death.<br/>
16 Therefore, I will punish him
and then release him.”</p>
<p>18 But the whole crowd shouted, “Away with this man! Release
Barabbas to us!”<br/>
19 (Barabbas had been thrown into prison for
an insurrection in the city, and for murder.)</p>
<p>20 Wanting to release Jesus, Pilate appealed to them again.<br/>
21
But they kept shouting, “Crucify him! Crucify him!”</p>
<p>22 For the third time he spoke to them: “Why? What crime has
this man committed? I have found in him no grounds for the death
penalty. Therefore, I will have him punished and then release him.”</p>
<p>23 But with loud shouts they insistently demanded that he be
crucified, and their shouts prevailed.<br/>
24 So Pilate decided to
grant their demand.<br/>
25 He released the man who had been thrown
into prison for insurrection and murder, the one they asked for, and
surrendered Jesus to their will.</p>
<hr/>

<h3><strong>Luke 23:26–31</strong></h3>
<p><strong>The Crucifixion of Jesus</strong></p>
<p>26 As the soldiers led him away, they seized Simon from Cyrene,
who was on his way in from the country, and put the cross on him and
made him carry it behind Jesus.</p>
<p>27 A large number of people followed him, including women who
mourned and wailed for him.<br/>
28 Jesus turned and said to them,
“Daughters of Jerusalem, do not weep for me; weep for yourselves
and for your children.<br/>
29 For the time will come when you will
say, ‘Blessed are the childless women, the wombs that never bore
and the breasts that never nursed!’<br/>
30 Then “‘they will
say to the mountains, “Fall on us!” and to the hills, “Cover
us!”’<br/>
31 For if people do these things when the tree is
green, what will happen when it is dry?”</p>
<hr/>

<p>Would you like me to continue with the crucifixion and the events

<h3><strong>Luke 23:32–38</strong></h3>
<p><strong>The Crucifixion</strong></p>
<p>32 Two other men, both criminals, were also led out with him to be
executed.<br/>
33 When they came to the place called the Skull, they
crucified him there, along with the criminals—one on his right, the
other on his left.</p>
<p>34 Jesus said, “Father, forgive them, for they do not know what
they are doing.” And they divided up his clothes by casting lots.</p>
<p>35 The people stood watching, and the rulers even sneered at him.
They said, “He saved others; let him save himself if he is God’s
Messiah, the Chosen One.”</p>
<p>36 The soldiers also came up and mocked him. They offered him wine
vinegar<br/>
37 and said, “If you are the king of the Jews, save
yourself.”</p>
<p>38 There was a written notice above him, which read: THIS IS THE
KING OF THE JEWS.</p>
<hr/>

<h3><strong>Luke 23:39–43</strong></h3>
<p><strong>The Criminals Speak</strong></p>
<p>39 One of the criminals who hung there hurled insults at him:
“Aren’t you the Messiah? Save yourself and us!”</p>
<p>40 But the other criminal rebuked him. “Don’t you fear God,”
he said, “since you are under the same sentence?<br/>
41 We are
punished justly, for we are getting what our deeds deserve. But this
man has done nothing wrong.”</p>
<p>42 Then he said, “Jesus, remember me when you come into your
kingdom.”</p>
<p>43 Jesus answered him, “Truly I tell you, today you will be with
me in paradise.”</p>
<hr/>

<h3><strong>Luke 23:44–49</strong></h3>
<p><strong>The Death of Jesus</strong></p>
<p>44 It was now about noon, and darkness came over the whole land
until three in the afternoon,<br/>
45 for the sun stopped shining.
And the curtain of the temple was torn in two.<br/>
46 Jesus called
out with a loud voice, “Father, into your hands I commit my
spirit.” When he had said this, he breathed his last.</p>
<p>47 The centurion, seeing what had happened, praised God and said,
“Surely this was a righteous man.”<br/>
48 When all the people
who had gathered to witness this sight saw what took place, they beat
their breasts and went away.<br/>
49 But all those who knew him,
including the women who had followed him from Galilee, stood at a
distance, watching these things.</p>
<hr/>

<h3><strong>Luke 23:50–56</strong></h3>
<p><strong>The Burial of Jesus</strong></p>
<p>50 Now there was a man named Joseph, a member of the Council, a
good and upright man,<br/>
51 who had not consented to their decision
and action. He came from the Judean town of Arimathea, and he himself
was waiting for the kingdom of God.<br/>
52 Going to Pilate, he asked
for Jesus’ body.<br/>
53 Then he took it down, wrapped it in linen
cloth and placed it in a tomb cut in the rock, one in which no one
had yet been laid.<br/>
54 It was Preparation Day, and the Sabbath
was about to begin.</p>
<p>55 The women who had come with Jesus from Galilee followed Joseph
and saw the tomb and how his body was laid in it.<br/>
56 Then they
went home and prepared spices and perfumes. But they rested on the
Sabbath in obedience to the commandment.</p>
<hr/>

<p>This concludes <strong>Luke 23</strong>. Would you like me to

<h3><strong>Luke 24:1–12</strong></h3>
<p><strong>The Resurrection</strong></p>
<p>1 On the first day of the week, very early in the morning, the
women took the spices they had prepared and went to the tomb.<br/>
2
They found the stone rolled away from the tomb,<br/>
3 but when they
entered, they did not find the body of the Lord Jesus.</p>
<p>4 While they were wondering about this, suddenly two men in
clothes that gleamed like lightning stood beside them.<br/>
5 In
their fright, the women bowed down with their faces to the ground,
but the men said to them, “Why do you look for the living among the
dead?<br/>
6 He is not here; he has risen! Remember how he told you,
while he was still with you in Galilee:<br/>
7 ‘The Son of Man must
be delivered over to the hands of sinners, be crucified and on the
third day be raised again.’”<br/>
8 Then they remembered his
words.</p>
<p>9 When they came back from the tomb, they told all these things to
the Eleven and to all the others.<br/>
10 It was Mary Magdalene,
Joanna, Mary the mother of James, and the others with them who told
this to the apostles.<br/>
11 But they did not believe the women,
because their words seemed to them like nonsense.<br/>
12 Peter,
however, got up and ran to the tomb. Bending over, he saw the strips
of linen lying by themselves, and he went away, wondering to himself
what had happened.</p>
<hr/>

<h3><strong>Luke 24:13–35</strong></h3>
<p><strong>The Road to Emmaus</strong></p>
<p>13 Now that same day two of them were going to a village called
Emmaus, about seven miles from Jerusalem.<br/>
14 They were talking
with each other about everything that had happened.<br/>
15 As they
talked and discussed these things with each other, Jesus himself came
up and walked along with them;<br/>
16 but they were kept from
recognizing him.</p>
<p>17 He asked them, “What are you discussing together as you walk
along?”</p>
<p>They stood still, their faces downcast.<br/>
18 One of them, named
Cleopas, asked him, “Are you the only one visiting Jerusalem who
does not know the things that have happened there in these days?”</p>
<p>19 “What things?” he asked.</p>
<p>“About Jesus of Nazareth,” they replied. “He was a prophet,
powerful in word and deed before God and all the people.<br/>
20 The
chief priests and our rulers handed him over to be sentenced to
death, and they crucified him;<br/>
21 but we had hoped that he was
the one who was going to redeem Israel. And what is more, it is the
third day since all this took place.<br/>
22 In addition, some of our
women amazed us. They went to the tomb early this morning<br/>
23 but
didn’t find his body. They came and told us that they had seen a
vision of angels, who said he was alive.<br/>
24 Then some of our
companions went to the tomb and found it just as the women had said,
but they did not see Jesus.”</p>
<p>25 He said to them, “How foolish you are, and how slow to
believe all that the prophets have spoken!<br/>
26 Did not the
Messiah have to suffer these things and then enter his glory?”<br/>
27
And beginning with Moses and all the Prophets, he explained to them
what was said in all the Scriptures concerning himself.</p>
<p>28 As they approached the village to which they were going, Jesus
continued on as if he were going farther.<br/>
29 But they urged him
strongly, “Stay with us, for it is nearly evening; the day is
almost over.” So he went in to stay with them.</p>
<p>30 When he was at the table with them, he took bread, gave thanks,
broke it and began to give it to them.<br/>
31 Then their eyes were
opened and they recognized him, and he disappeared from their
sight.<br/>
32 They asked each other, “Were not our hearts burning
within us while he talked with us on the road and opened the
Scriptures to us?”</p>
<p>33 They got up and returned at once to Jerusalem. There they found
the Eleven and those with them, assembled together<br/>
34 and
saying, “It is true! The Lord has risen and has appeared to
Simon.”<br/>
35 Then the two told what had happened on the way, and
how Jesus was recognized by them when he broke the bread.</p>

<h3><strong>Luke 24:36–49</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Jesus Appears to the Disciples</strong></p>
<p>36 While they were still talking about this, Jesus himself stood
among them and said to them, “Peace be with you.”<br/>
37 They
were startled and frightened, thinking they saw a ghost.</p>
<p>38 He said to them, “Why are you troubled, and why do doubts
rise in your minds?<br/>
39 Look at my hands and my feet. It is I
myself! Touch me and see; a ghost does not have flesh and bones, as
you see I have.”</p>
<p>40 When he had said this, he showed them his hands and feet.<br/>
41
And while they still did not believe it because of joy and amazement,
he asked them, “Do you have anything here to eat?”<br/>
42 They
gave him a piece of broiled fish,<br/>
43 and he took it and ate it
in their presence.</p>
<p>44 He said to them, “This is what I told you while I was still
with you: Everything must be fulfilled that is written about me in
the Law of Moses, the Prophets, and the Psalms.”</p>
<p>45 Then he opened their minds so they could understand the
Scriptures.<br/>
46 He told them, “This is what is written: The
Messiah will suffer and rise from the dead on the third day,<br/>
47
and repentance for the forgiveness of sins will be preached in his
name to all nations, beginning at Jerusalem.<br/>
48 You are
witnesses of these things.<br/>
49 I am going to send you what my
Father has promised; but stay in the city until you have been clothed
with power from on high.”</p>

<p>50 When he had led them out to the vicinity of Bethany, he lifted
up his hands and blessed them.<br/>
51 While he was blessing them, he
left them and was taken up into heaven.<br/>
52 Then they worshiped
him and returned to Jerusalem with great joy.<br/>
53 And they stayed
continually at the temple, praising God.</p>

<h6>ChatGPT said:</h6>
<p>ChatGPT</p>
<p>The comparison between canonical <strong>Luke</strong> and the
reconstruction of <strong>Marcion's Evangelion</strong> highlights
significant differences in content, tone, and theological emphasis.
These differences often suggest that the canonical text has undergone
substantial addition and revision. Here's a summary and analysis of
key observations:</p>
<hr/>

<h3><strong>Summary of Additions</strong></h3>
<ol>
	<li><p><strong>Birth Narratives and Genealogies</strong></p>
	<ul>
		<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">Marcion's text reportedly lacks
		the birth narrative of Jesus and the genealogy in <strong>Luke 3</strong>.
		These additions in canonical Luke appear to emphasize Jesus'
		connection to Jewish prophecy and lineage, reinforcing his role as
		the fulfillment of the Old Testament.</p></li>
	</ul>
	<li><p><strong>Fulfillment of Prophecy</strong></p>
	<ul>
		<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">Canonical Luke contains frequent
		references to the fulfillment of Jewish prophecy, particularly in
		Jesus’ passion and resurrection narratives (e.g., Luke 22:37,
		Luke 24:44). These references are absent in Marcion’s version,
		which aligns with his theology that rejects the Old Testament God
		and its prophecies.</p></li>
	</ul>
	<li><p><strong>Post-Resurrection Appearances and Teachings</strong></p>
	<ul>
		<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">Marcion’s Gospel seems to end
		abruptly after Jesus’ resurrection, without the extensive
		post-resurrection appearances and teachings found in <strong>Luke
		24</strong>. The additions in canonical Luke emphasize the
		continuity of Jesus' mission and the authority of his disciples.</p></li>
	</ul>
	<li><p><strong>Moral and Ethical Teachings</strong></p>
	<ul>
		<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">Canonical Luke includes numerous
		parables and moral teachings, such as the <strong>Good Samaritan</strong>
		(Luke 10) and <strong>The Prodigal Son</strong> (Luke 15). These
		are absent in Marcion’s version, which may reflect his focus on
		the salvific role of Christ over ethical instructions.</p></li>
	</ul>
	<li><p><strong>Expansion of Events</strong></p>
	<ul>
		<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">Several events in canonical Luke
		are more detailed or extended compared to Marcion's text. For
		example:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">The account of the <strong>Last
			Supper</strong> in canonical Luke (Luke 22:14–20) includes the
			institution of the Eucharist, which Marcion's version omits or
			shortens.</p></li>
			<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">The <strong>trial before Pilate
			and Herod</strong> (Luke 23:6–12) is expanded in canonical Luke.</p></li>
		</ul>
	</ul>
	<li><p><strong>Trinitarian and Theological Additions</strong></p>
	<ul>
		<li><p>Canonical Luke emphasizes the connection between Jesus, the
		Father, and the Holy Spirit more than Marcion’s text does.
		References to the Holy Spirit and Jesus’ divine authority may
		have been amplified or added.</p></li>
	</ul>
</ol>
<hr/>

<h3><strong>Theological Implications</strong></h3>
<ol>
	<li><p><strong>Jewish Roots of Christianity</strong></p>
	<ul>
		<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">Canonical Luke weaves Jesus’
		story into the fabric of Jewish history and prophecy, presenting
		him as the fulfillment of the Law and Prophets. This directly
		counters Marcion's view, which sought to sever Christianity from
		its Jewish roots. Many of the added sections seem designed to
		reinforce this connection.</p></li>
	</ul>
	<li><p><strong>Christology</strong></p>
	<ul>
		<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">Marcion emphasized Jesus as a
		savior sent by a higher, previously unknown God, distinct from the
		creator-God of the Old Testament. Canonical Luke, with its
		references to prophecy fulfillment and Jewish scripture, presents a
		more integrated Christology that ties Jesus to the God of Israel.</p></li>
	</ul>
	<li><p><strong>Ethical Teachings</strong></p>
	<ul>
		<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">Marcion’s Gospel was focused on
		salvation through faith in Jesus Christ, while canonical Luke
		emphasizes Jesus as a moral teacher and example. The inclusion of
		parables and ethical instructions reflects a broader vision of
		Jesus’ mission.</p></li>
	</ul>
	<li><p><strong>Post-Resurrection Authority</strong></p>
	<ul>
		<li><p>The inclusion of post-resurrection appearances and teachings
		in canonical Luke establishes the authority of the apostles and the
		continuity of the church. This aligns with the Catholic view of
		apostolic succession, contrasting Marcion’s narrower focus on
		Paul’s writings.</p></li>
	</ul>
</ol>
<hr/>

<h3><strong>Analysis</strong></h3>
<ol>
	<li><p><strong>Pattern of Additions</strong></p>
	<ul>
		<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">It seems more plausible that
		canonical Luke represents an expansion of Marcion’s shorter text
		rather than Marcion’s text being an abridgement of Luke. Scholars
		generally agree that scribes and editors were far more likely to
		add explanatory and theological material than to remove it,
		especially material that would align with orthodox theology.</p></li>
	</ul>
	<li><p><strong>Purpose of Additions</strong></p>
	<ul>
		<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">Many of the added sections in
		canonical Luke serve to align the Gospel with developing church
		orthodoxy:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">Strengthening the connection
			between Jesus and Jewish prophecy.</p></li>
			<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">Emphasizing ethical teachings to
			support communal guidelines.</p></li>
			<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">Establishing the authority of
			the apostles and the church.</p></li>
		</ul>
	</ul>
	<li><p><strong>Historical Context</strong></p>
	<ul>
		<li><p>Marcion’s Gospel and theology likely represented an early,
		streamlined version of Christian doctrine. The church’s
		response—embodied in canonical Luke—was to produce a more
		robust and integrated narrative that defended Jesus’ Jewish roots
		and addressed emerging theological debates.</p></li>
	</ul>
</ol>
<hr/>

<h3><strong>Conclusion</strong></h3>
<p>The evidence strongly supports the idea that canonical Luke is an
expanded version of Marcion’s Evangelion, rather than the reverse.
The additions in canonical Luke reflect theological, liturgical, and
ethical concerns of the early church, often in direct response to
Marcion's interpretation of Christianity.</p>
<p>While Marcion’s Gospel may not represent the “original” form
of Luke, it provides a critical lens through which we can understand
the development of early Christian texts and theology. The
differences between the two highlight the complex process of gospel
formation and the diversity of early Christian thought.</p>
